You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset.
She's going off about something that you said
She doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh
I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know your about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me

You belong with me
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (stop)and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
(It's like jelly baby)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
(Just like honey to the bee baby)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
More than a distant
Over a shining sea
More than the steaming green
More than the shining eyes

Well they tell me it's only a drea in Rio
Nothing could be as sweet as it seems
On this very first day down
They remind me
Son have you so soon forgotten
Often as not it's rotten inside
And the mask soon slips away
Strange taste of a tropical fruit
Romantic language of the portugese
Melody on a wooden flute
Samba floating in the summer breeze

Take it easy

It's alright you can stay asleep
You can close your eyes
You can trust the people of paradise
To call your keeper
And tender your goodbyes

Oh what a night
Wonderful one in a million
Frozen fire brazilian stars
Oh holy southern cross
Later on
Take me way downtown in a tincan
I cant come down from the bandstand
I'm never thrown for souch a loss
When they say

Quando a nossa mae acordar
Andareimos au sol
Quando a nossa mae acordar
Cantara pelos sertao
Quando a nossa mae acordar
Todos os filios saberao
Todos os filios saberao
E regozijarao

Caught in the rays of the rising sun
On the run from the soldiers gun
Shouting out loud from the angry crowd
The mild the wild and the hungry child

I'll tell you
It's more than a dream in Rio
I was there on the very day
And my heart came back alive

There was more
More than the singing voices
More than the upturned faces
And more than the shining eyes
But it's more than the shining eye
More than the steaming green
More than the hidden hills
More than the concrete christ
More than a distant land
Over a shining sea
More than the hungry child
More like another time
Born of a million years
More than a million yers
Say your sorry
That face of an angel comes out
Just when you need it to.
As I pace back and forth
All this time cause
I honestly believed in you.
Holdin' on 
The days drag on
Stupid girl I should have known, I should have known.

That I'm not a princess. 
This ain't a fairytale.
I'm not the one you sweep off her feet,
Lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now it's to late for you and your white horse to come around.

Maybe I was naÎve, got lost in your eyes,
I never really had a chance.
I had so many dreams about you and me.
Happy endings, well now I know...

That I'm not a princess.
This ain't a fairytale.
I'm not the one you sweep off her feet,
lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around.

And there you are on your knees.
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me.
Just like I always wanted but, I'm so sorry.

Cause I'm not your princess.
This ain't a fairytale.
I'm gonna find someone some day, who might actually treat me well.
This is a big world.
That was a small town, there in my rearview mirror disappearing now.
And it's too late for you and your white horse...
Its too late for you and your white horse to
catch me now.

Oh, Oh,Oh,
Try and catch me now ohh
Its too late
To catch me now
Say your sorry
That face of an angel comes out
Just when you need it to.
As I pace back and forth
All this time cause
I honestly believed in you.
Holdin' on 
The days drag on
Stupid girl I should have known, I should have known.

That I'm not a princess. 
This ain't a fairytale.

Oh, Oh,Oh,
Try and catch me now ohh
Its too late
To catch me now
Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
darling I know, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

(repeat chorus)

ohhhhhh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah

(repeat chorus)

oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
chorus:
you are my only one
you are my only one
well i'm telling you now you're my only one

i've got two long legs like to carry me
two sharp eyes to look for the light
two strong arms to hold on tight
two good friends on my left and right
but only one only one

chorus:
you are my only one you are my only one
don't be leaving me now you're my only one

now there's only one road before me
too many turns in the way
thousands of things to do today
millions of moments i must admit
but only one only one

chorus

taken for granted and pushed aside
all that it wanted was a place to run and hide
missing message in a hollow tree
hidden deep inside a memory
and the memory seems like dreams
hundreds of hopes in the past
nevertheless it was never the last
hold on strong or you fade out fast
and only one only one

chorus
You said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck,
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
On backroads at night
An' I was right there beside him all summer long
An' then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone

But when you think: Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long:
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness,
I hope you think: "That little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest,
An' my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears,
An' thankin' God that you weren't here,
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed,
Is a letter that you never read,
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,
An' lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe:

When you think: Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long:
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness,
I hope you think: "That little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest,
An' my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then:
I'm standin' on your street,
An' there's a letter left on your doorstep,
An' the first thing that you'll read:

Is: "When you think: Tim McGraw,
"I hope you think my favorite song"
Some day you'll turn your radio on,
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness,
I hope you think: "That little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest,
An' my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me,
Mmmm

You said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie"
Whenever I see your smiling face
I have to smile myself
Because I love you, yes I do

And when you give me that pretty little pout
It turns me inside out
There's something about you, baby
I don't know

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
If it grows stronger every day
Oh, how much longer

I thought I was in love a couple of times before
With the girl next door
But that was long before I met you
Now I'm sure that I won't forget you

And I thank my lucky stars
That you are who you are
And not just another lovely lady
Sent down to break my heart

Isn't it amazing a man like me
Can feel this way
Tell me how much longer
If it grows stronger every day, yeah
How much longer?

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see you smile at me
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
Whenever I see your smiling face my way

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today
No no darling

Ad lib to end...
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life

I want to stop (stop)and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
Person to person
And man to man
I'm back in touch
With my long lost friend

Listen to reason
And understand
And think of me
From way back when

He said me and Melissa
Well, we fell out of love
Ran out of luck
Seems like lightning struck

I've been thinkin' of leavin'
But I can't raise a buck
James, I'm wondering
Could I borrow your truck

I said that's why I'm here
(That's why I'm here)
Got no better reason
That's why I'm standing before you
(That's why I'm here)
That's why I'm here

John's gone found dead
He dies high he's brown bread
Later said to have
Drowned in his bed

After the laughter
The wave of the dread
It hits us like a ton of lead

It seems "learn not to burn"
Means turn on a dime
Walk on if you're walking
Even if it's an uphill climb

Try to remember that
Working's no crime
Just don't let 'em take
And waste your time

That's why I'm here
(That's why I'm here)
There'll be no more messes tonight
That's why I'm here
(That's why I'm here)
Whoa, that's why I'm here

This is an I.O.U.
I reckon I owe you one now
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria
This'll be better tomorrow

Oh, fortune and fame's
Such a curious game
Perfect strangers
Can call you by name

And pay good money to hear
"Fire And Rain"
Again and again and again

Oh, some are like summer
Coming back every year
Got your baby, got your blanket
Got your bucket of beer

I break into a grin
From ear to ear
And suddenly
It's perfectly clear

That's why I'm here
(That's why I'm here)
Singing tonight, tomorrow
And every day
That's why standin'
(That's why I'm here)
Whoa, that's why I'm here

This is the part
About Kitty and Bim
He loved her
And she loved him

Wake 'em up, shake 'em up
The middle of the night
You got to tell me
Everything's all right

I said that's why I'm here
(That's why I'm here)
You got me walkin' and
Talkin' like a natural man
That's why I'm here
(That's why I'm here)
Whoa, that's why I'm here

That's right
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life

With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (stop)and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd
and say hello;

Little did I know
That you were Romeo; you were throwing pebbles,
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase,
begging you, 'Please, don't go.'"

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes; escape this town for a little while.
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet,"
But you were everything to me; I was begging you, 'Please, don't go,'"

And I said,
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'

Romeo save me - they're tryin' to tell me how to feel;
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid; we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a life story - baby just say "Yes.'"

Oh.

I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever comin' around.
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town,

And I said,
"Romeo save me - I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you but you never come.
Is this in thy head? I don't know what to think-"

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said, 
"Marry me, Juliet - you'll never have to be alone.
I love you and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress;
It's a love story - baby just say 'Yes.'"

Oh, oh.

We were both young when I first saw you...
I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin for a reason
I know,
I didn't read between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothin' seems to work the first few times
Am I right


So how can I ever, try to be better
Nobody ever, let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside lookin' in
I've been alot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything


So how can I ever, try to be better
Nobody ever, let's me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside lookin' in
I've been alot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


Oh, yeah


So how could I ever, try to be better
Nobody ever, let's me in
And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside lookin' in
I've been alot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside


Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as I am

And what about your dad
Did you think of what he'll say
Will he be understanding
Or does he think the usual way

Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've been through this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door

Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
If she says forget about me
Do you think you'll understand

And what about your friends
Do you care what people say
Will you accept the burdens
I know will surely come your way

Maybe I shouldn't worry
But I've been through this before
And I'd like to get things straight
Before I'm knocking on your door

Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as I am

Oh, we've got to stand tall
Tumble or crawl
We've got to be strong
For a love that's so right
Can't be wrong
And everyday I see it grow
I don't wanna let it go
That's why I gotta know

Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Hey girls gather 'round
Listen to what I'm putting down
Hey baby, I'm your handy man
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule
I'm handy with love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can

If your broken heart should need repair
Then I am the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends
They'll come running to me
Here is the main thing that I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can

Comma, comma, comma, comma, come, come, comma
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Comma, comma, comma, comma, come, come
Oh, they'll come running to me
Here is the main thing I want to say
I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, baby I'm your handy man

Comma, comma, comma, comma, come, come, comma
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Comma, comma, comma, comma, come, come, comma
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's me (comma, comma, comma, comma, come, come)
I'm your handy man (yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's me (comma, comma, comma, comma, come, come)
I'm your handy man (yeah, yeah, yeah)
chorus:
you are my only one
you are my only one
well i'm telling you now you're my only one

i've got two long legs like to carry me
two sharp eyes to look for the light
two strong arms to hold on tight

taken for granted and pushed aside
all that it wanted was a place to run and hide
missing message in a hollow tree
hidden deep inside a memory

Notes:

JT on Sony.com: Yer love jones.
Gotta watchdog watching me
Watching me packing my bags
He knows I'm leaving town
I can see that it's a drag
Why leave the life I love
Here in the great state of Maine
Just to ride that shining rail
Just to size that ball and chain

Gotta spend just a little more time with you
That's why
Gotta spend just a little more time with you
Oh oh oh
Gotta spend just a little more time with you
Yes I do, yes I do
Gotta spend just a little more time with you
Oh oh oh oh oh

I passed on the cocaine
Said bye-bye to my methadone
Put down the bottle for one more day
Backing off of my Tobacco Jones
Still I feel like a hopeless junkie
Like a man who can't say no
I look back and there's that monkey
Rascal won't let go

Gotta spend just a little more time with you

I get high and I can't come down
I get high just hanging around
I get high, I go lost and found
I get high oh I oh I

Gotta spend just a little more time with you
I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight i really need to know

CHORUS
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

CHORUS

Love...love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No...I can't let you go...

CHORUS

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart

Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

CHORUS (until fade)
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful,
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing,
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight,
Give him all her love,
Look in those beautiful eyes,
And know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing,
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light,
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing,
Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up
But there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that no one knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say
Hey by the way


You're beautiful
Every little piece love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope you're life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it don't
Stay beautiful


If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
at least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh but if it don't

Will you stay beautiful...beautiful ah bea-ti-ful
Beautiful ah bea-ti-ful beautiful

Oh if it dont
Stay beautiful

Keep it covered
Think your baby won't understand
Blame your mother
You say anything to hold them down
But we're on to you now, now

See them coming
Well they're always knocking on your door
Take your money
Never tell you what the hell it's for
And you'll be rolling over sticks and stones
And nothing on this earth can break your bones
And I always thought you were so damn tall
But I really didn't know you at all

Solo flyin mystery man
Won't you take me on a ride
Cos I've been waitin all my life to hear you
Say you want me, I said
I said I swear it's true
Every guy I know
Trying to get ahead
Working two jobs
Til you're almost dead
(You tell em)

Work your fingers
Right down to the bone
There's a cat named Jody
Sneaking around in your home

There's a cat named Jody
In every town
Spending lots of cash
And just riding around

Ride on, Jody
Ride on, ride on
With your bad self
Jody

The ashes in your ashtray
Footprints on your carpet
While you work all day
He even got the nerve
To sleep in your bed
Sit down at the table
Eat your bread

When you get home
After working hard all day
Jody's got your girl
Top40db.com
Top40db.net

And he don't play

I said
Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone

(It ain't no sense in going home)
(You gotta get home but
You work too hard)
(It ain't no sense in going home)
(You gotta get home but
You work too hard)

Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone)
I tell you, Jody's got
Your girl and gone
(Ain't no sense in going home)

When you discover
Your gross neglect
Itll be too late to
Give your woman respect

You'll hunt down Jody ?
Ten thousand dollar reward
For Jody's hide

Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone.....
(non vocal)
There is a young cowboy he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Just waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear
He says

Goodnight you moonlight ladies.
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James.
Deep greens and blues for the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James

The first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing seem to work for me

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Oh, rock-a-bye sweet baby James

State the obvious,
I didn’t get my perfect fantasy

So watch me strike out a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I’m concerned,
You’re just another picture to burn

There’s no time for tears

Lyrics
Wake up, little darling
It`s time to go home
If sunrise catch us sleeping
We`ll be caught up in the wrong

Last time we were together
You made it home in
Just the nick of time
We got so much love between us
It`s getting hard to meet the deadline

We`re getting careless with our love
We`re getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair

Wake up, little darling
Because time, it won`t stand still
Going home to someone
You don`t love no more
I know it`s against your will

I hate to see you leave
With tears all over your face
Just like Sherlock Holmes
The whole world is on my case

We`re getting careless with our love
I can`t help but get careless with our love
We`re getting careless with our love affair

Some people say that it`s wrong
But it`s the only love we know
And it keeps on getting strong

Everytime we see each other
Our love gets a little stronger
That`s why I don`t want you to leave
I wanna hold you a little longer

We`re getting careless with our love
I can`t help but get careless with our love
We`re getting careless with our love affair

Lord, have mercy now
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

I think we better find, I think
We better find another meeting place
Before the whole world is gonna know
We might mess around
And make a disgrace

You see, honey
The rumors are spreading
The rumors are spreading all over town
And we don`t wanna be like Mrs.Jones
We can`t meet at the same place

Every time I see you, baby
I know other folk can see that
Look that we have in our eyes

Yeah, when you see me
You`re supposed to walk on by
But I can feel it in my heart
That we`re getting careless
Careless, careless, careless

We`re getting careless
We`re getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
Careless, careless , yeah

We`re getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
We`re getting so careless......
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says baby is something wrong?
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
and he says...


Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said...

Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I could have"
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I... wrote down our song
We were ring-around-the-rosy children
They were circles around the sun
Never give up, never slow down
Never grow old, never ever die young

Synchronized with the rising moon
Even with the evening star
They were true love written in stone
They were never alone, they were never that far apart

And we who couldn't bear to believe they might make it
We got to close our eyes
Cut up our losses into doable doses
Ration our tears and sighs

You could see them on the street on a Saturday night
Everyone used to run them down
They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight
Not enough tough for this town

We couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole
No, it didn't seem to rattle at all
They were glued together body and soul
That much more with their backs up against the wall

Oh, hold them up, hold them up
Never do let them fall
Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin
That names us and claims us and shames us all

I guess it had to happen someday soon
wasn't nothing to hold them down
They would rise from among us like a big balloon
Take to the sky, forsake the ground

Oh, yes, other hearts were broken
Yeah, other dreams ran dry
But our golden ones sail on, sail on
To another land beneath another sky
I'll always love you
For the rest of my days
You have won my heart and my soul
With your sweet, Sexy ways
You gave me hope
When I needed someone near
You bring me happiness
Everyday of every year
And I'll always love you
For all that you are
You have made my life complete
You're my lucky star
Your are the one
That I'd been searching for
You are my everything
Tell me who could ask for more
And I'll always love you
Honey, this will never end
I need you by my side, baby
You're my lover my friend
Oh, my friend
You gave my world
A thrill I've never known
And filled my eager heart
With a love to call my own
And I'll always love you
You must know how much I do
You can count on me forever
And I will take good care
Of you
I'll always love you
I'm so happy that your mine
I always love you
Till the end of time
(James Taylor) On my own How could I have known? Imagine my surprise Just a fool From a tree full of fools Who can't believe his eyes Imagine my surprise I was a mean old man I was an ornery cuss I was a dismal Dan I made an awful fuss Ever since my life began Man, it was ever thus I was a nasty tyke who was hard to like I had to misbehave I did things in reverse Refused to wash or shave I was horrid to my nurse I got back what I gave Which only made me worse I had to have my way Which was bleak and gray, oh dear Living in here One hundred years of rain Such a drag This riches to rags With just myself to blame A dirty low-down shame Silly me Silly old me Somewhere outside my mind Clever you Walking me through Willing to lead the blind Just in the nick of time Who gets a second chance? Who gets to have some fun? Who gets to learn to dance Before his race is run? Who gets to shed his skin? Who comes up born again? Who was a mean old man 'Til you turned him into a golden retriever Puppy dog Who's a good boy?

When I was a little girl
Only twelve years old
Couldn't do nothing to save my dog gone soul
My mama told me the day I was grown
She says "Sing the blues child, Sing it from now on".

I'm a woman, oh yeah
I'm a woman, I'm a ball of fire
I'm a woman, I can make love to a crocodile
I'm a woman, I can sing the blues
I'm a woman, I can change old to new

Spell w o uma n
Oh yeah

That means I'm grown
I'm a woman, I'm a rushing wind
I'm a woman, I can cut stone with a pin
I'm a woman, I'm a love maker
I'm a woman, you know I'm an earth shaker

I'm a woman, I'm a rushing wind
I'm a woman, I can cut stone with a pin
I'm a woman, I know my stuff
I'm a woman, I ain't never had enough

I'm going down yonder, behind the sun
I'm gonna do something for you, that ain't never been done
I'm gonna hold back the lightning, with the palm of my hand
Shake hands with the devil, make him crawl in the sand

I'm a woman, oh yeah
I'm a woman, I'm a ball of fire
I'm a woman, I can make love to a crcodile
I'm a woman, I'm a love maker
I'm a woman, you know I'm an earth shaker

oh oh oh I'm a woman
I wasn't searching
To end this hurting
But out of nowhere
You made me feel
I cried about it
I lied about it
And tired to doubt
This could be real
You've touched me far too much
I'm letting go of all the pain
I'm into you in every way
Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone I can hold
Baby now
Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that lays and waits inside your heart
It still astounds me
The way you found me
It's almost too good
To be true
From our first meeting
I had the feeling
The rest of my life
I'd spend with you
I can't just turn my back
On everything I've heard you say
I'm into you in every way
Chorus
I thought that love was only a word
I'd never feel
All the passion I hold inside
Was simply just a dream
Out of your heart you gave to me
I know it's real
And I've fallen
So in love with you
Chorus
I wasn't searching
To end this hurting
But out of nowhere
You made me feel
I cried about it
I lied about it
And tired to doubt
This could be real
You've touched me far too much
I'm letting go of all the pain

So in love with you
Chorus
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (stop)and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
(It's like jelly baby)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
(Just like honey to the bee baby)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
All you fellows, gather 'round me
And let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheating on your woman
There's something you never even thought of, and that is

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love [(hear me now]
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I've seen so, so many fellows
Fall in that same old bag
Thinking that a woman is made to,
To be beat on and treated so bad
Oh, fellows, let me ask you something
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of,
[repeat chorus]

I know there are some women gives the other excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life, boy it's up to you
Oh, you oh, you,

Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh, that's when it all happened
Something I never, never dreamed of

Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Now who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love
(Who? Who? Your old lady) (While you were out making love)
Long ago a young man sits
And plays his waiting game
Things are not the same it seems
As in such tender dreams

Slowly passing sailing ships
And Sunday afternoons
Like people on the moon I see
Are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end
Why is this song so sad
These are the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love to love
Is just a word I've heard
When things are being said

Stories my poor head has told me
Cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been
And what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas
And bits of broken glass

Where do your golden rainbows end
Why is the song I sing so sad
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love to love
To love to love to love

Oh no no no no
Long ago a young man sits
And plays his waiting game
Things are not the same it seems
As in such tender dreams

Slowly passing sailing ships
And Sunday afternoons
Like people on the moon I see
Are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end
Why is this song so sad
These are the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love to love
Is just a word I've heard
When things are being said

Stories my poor head has told me
Cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been
And what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas
And bits of broken glass

Where do your golden rainbows end
Why is the song I sing so sad
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love to love
To love to love to love

Oh no no no no
I do believe
I must believe
I think I can begin again
Become again the man I was back when

So I'm walking on your streets again
Feeling now as I did then
I've since become a different man

London Town, turn be around
London Town, carry me back
O London Town, lost and found
And I feel like going back

I can remember lots of time and space
If I lose the name, still I know the faces
Time as come and left its traces

London Town, turn be around
London Town, carry me back
O London Town, lost and found
And I feel like going back

When I grew too old and dull to rock 'n roll
Like to hold on tight to you darling
And when my fires have all burned out
I'd like to think I can still think about
The things I used to sing about
When I was spending all my time alone
By myself and on my own
Seldom seen and quite unknown

London Town, turn be around
London Town, carry me back
O London Town, lost and found
And I feel like going back
Christmas future is far away
Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today
Bringing joy that may last

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
In a year our troubles will be out of sight
From now on

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
In a year our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Precious friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

I know that
In a year we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Until then, we'll just have to muddle through somehow
And have ourselves a merry little Christmas now.
I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight i really need to know

CHORUS
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

CHORUS

Love...love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No...I can't let you go...

CHORUS

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart

Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

CHORUS (until fade)
This land is a lovely green
It reminds me of my own home
Such children I've seldom seen
Even in my own home
The sky so bright and clean
Just like my home
Kind people as have ever been
Won't you take me back to my own home

CHORUS:
Jump up behind me my love
Jump up behind me
Old Dan can bear us both
Jump up behind me
We follow this road 'til we reach the sea
Jump up behind me
We'll catch the tide and set Dan free
Jump up behind me

I've been in this world awhile
And I've seen a lot of country
Many days and many miles
All various and sundry
I've had my way and I've had my fun
And I've had my chance to run free
Burning hot beneath the sun
Freezing cold and wintry

REPEAT CHORUS

I know now
Only one thing matters in these days
One thing, true love
Love and love alone
True love

I came out of a dream last night
Thought I was back in my old home
Mom and Dad were both still alive
And the babies not yet born, no
Felt like a festival
Felt like a Christmas morning
Felt the darkness fall away
Even as the world was turning
When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, oh, nothing is going right,
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running (oh yeah, baby)
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, (yeah yeah yeah)
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together now
And call my name out loud
Soon I'll be knocking upon your door

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running (Oh, yes I will)
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah yes

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold?
They hurt you and desert you,
Well, they take your soul if you let them,
Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name
And, you know, wherever I am
I'll come running
To see you again
(Oh baby don't you know 'bout)
Winter, spring, summer or fall
(Hey Now) All you've got to do is call
I'll be there, yes

You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
darling I know, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

(repeat chorus)

ohhhhhh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah

(repeat chorus)

oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Will she turn her back on me
Or accept me as I am

And what about your dad
Did you think of what he'll say
Will he be understanding
Or does he think the usual way

Can't be wrong
And everyday I see it grow
I don't wanna let it go
That's why I gotta know

Oh no no ah ah

CHORUS (until fade)
There's something in the way she moves,

Or looks my way, or calls my name,

That seems to leave this troubled world behind.

If I'm feeling down and blue,

Or troubled by some foolish game,

She always seems to make me change my mind.


Chorus:

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,

She's around me now

Almost all the time.

And If I'm well you can tell that she's been with me now,

And she's been with me now

Quite a long, long time

And I feel fine.


Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning,

And I find myself convening

In places where I should not let me go.

She has the power to go where no one else can find me,

Yes, and to silently remind me

Of the happiness and good times that I know

But I said I just got to know them


It isn't what she's got to say

Or how she thinks or where she's been.

To me, the words are nice, the way they sound.

I like to hear them best that way

It doesn't much matter what they mean,

Well she says them mostly just to calm me down.


Chorus:

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,

She's around me now

Almost all the time.

If I'm well you can tell that she's been with me now,

And she's been with me now

Quite a long, long time

Yes, and I feel fine.
Every guy I know
Trying to get ahead
Working two jobs
Til you're almost dead
(You tell em)

Work your fingers
Right down to the bone
There's a cat named Jody
Sneaking around in your home

There's a cat named Jody
In every town
Spending lots of cash
And just riding around

Ride on, Jody
Ride on, ride on
With your bad self
Jody

The ashes in your ashtray
Footprints on your carpet
While you work all day
He even got the nerve
To sleep in your bed
Sit down at the table
Eat your bread

When you get home
After working hard all day
Jody's got your girl

Your gross neglect
Itll be too late to
Give your woman respect

You'll hunt down Jody ?
Ten thousand dollar reward
For Jody's hide

Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone.....
All my life I been a po' boy,
It's been hard to get a dime
Everythin' I got, umm, hmm
I had to pay for it on time, but that's all right

Long as I got a toehold
As long as I got a piece of you
As long as I got a toehold,
I can make it through.

Now listen
I said I went to my doctor,
First thing he talked about is malnutrition
I'm not tryin' to be a fatman,
I've got to look after my ambition.

Long as I got a toehold
Long as I got a piece of you
Long as I got a toehold,
I can make it through.

Oh, now give it to me baby
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
Oh!

&amp;lt;bridge&amp;gt;

So, baby!, if you're with me,
I'll let the whole world be against me.
I don't expect to ever get rich,
You may find me diggin' in a ditch.

Long as I got a toehold
Long as I got a piece of you
Long as I got a toehold,
I can make it through.

Oh, give it to me baby
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
A little little little little little little little little little toehold
Owwww!
That's all I want baby
I want a little little little little little little little little little toehold
I want a little little little little little little little little little toehold
Owwww!

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of nobody's way
It's your freshman new year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through those doors
There's somethin' about the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh, yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one-horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way, but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss
It's flawless
Really something
It's fearless

Oh, yeah
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Yeah
I don't know how
Oh, yeah, yeah
Well the sun is slowly sinking down
But the moon is surely rising
So this old world must still be spinning around
And I still love you

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes
It's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song when I'm gone

It won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
No one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes
It's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song when I'm gone
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
[Album version:] Taking flight, making me feel right
[Remix version:] Taking flight, making me feel right like

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said, "Hello."
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello."
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Boo doot boo
Boo doot boo.....etc.
(HACK!)

Bah biddly biddly biddly hop
Bah diddly diddly cuddly op
Bah diddly huddly bubbly buggly
Huddly clop (and other various gruntings)
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true
Cause I know you

Hold on baby you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows that you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on baby you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows that you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold one baby you're losing it
The water's high you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows that you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone


Goodbye baby
With a smile
Baby baby
Summer's here
I'm for that
Got my rubber sandals
Got my straw hat
Got my cold beer
I'm just glad that I'm here

Summer's here
That suits me fine
It may rain today
But I don't mind
It's my favorite time of the year
And I'm glad that I'm here

Old man wintertime
He goes so slow
It's ten degrees below, you know
You can take your ice and snow
And let my balmy breezes blow

Yeah, the water is cold but I've been in
Baby, lose the laundry and jump on in
I mean all God's children got skin
And it's summer again

Old man wintertime
He goes so slow
It's ten degrees below, you know
You can take your ice and snow
And let my balmy breezes blow

Summer's here
I'm for that
Got my rubber sandals
Got my straw hat
Drinking cold beer
Man I'm just that I'm here
It's my favorite time of the year
And I'm glad that I'm here, yeah
I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow 
Let it take me where it wants to go 
Til you open the door, there's so much more 
I've never seen it before 
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find my wings 
But you came along and you changed everything 

You lift my feet off the ground 
You spin me around 
You make me crazier crazier 
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes 
You make me crazier crazier crazier 

I watched from a distance as you made life your own 
Every sky was your own kind of blue 
And I wanted to know how that would feel 
And you made it so real 
You showed me something that I couldn't see 
You opened my eyes and you made me believe. 

You lift my feet off the ground 
You spin me around 
You make me crazier crazier 
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes 
You make me crazier crazier crazier oh 

Baby you showed me what livin' is for 
I don't wanna hide anymore 

You lift my feet off the ground 
You spin me around 
You make me crazier crazier 
Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes 
You make me crazier crazier crazier crazier crazier
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

Oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things comin' my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you
Fire and rain
Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
darling I know, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

(repeat chorus)

ohhhhhh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah

(repeat chorus)

oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
You have a way of coming easily to me.
And when you take, you take the very best of me.
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted.

(CHORUS)
Oh, what a shame.
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
Just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through, I've never been anywhere cold as you.

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray.
And I stood there lovin' you and washed them all away.
And you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.

(CHORUS)
Oh, what a shame.
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
So just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through, I've never been anywhere cold as you.

You never did give a damn thing, honey.
But I cried, cried for you.
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you.
(Died for you)

Oh, what a shame.
What a rainy ending give to a perfect day. Every smile you fake is so condescending.
Counted all the scars you made.
Now that I'm sittin her thinkin' it through, I've never been anywhere cold as you
I'll always love you
For the rest of my days
You have won my heart and my soul
With your sweet, Sexy ways
You gave me hope
When I needed someone near
You bring me happiness
Everyday of every year
And I'll always love you
For all that you are
You have made my life complete
You're my lucky star
Your are the one
That I'd been searching for
You are my everything
Tell me who could ask for more
And I'll always love you
Honey, this will never end
I need you by my side, baby
You're my lover my friend
Oh, my friend
You gave my world
A thrill I've never known
And filled my eager heart
With a love to call my own
And I'll always love you
You must know how much I do
You can count on me forever
And I will take good care
Of you
I'll always love you
I'm so happy that your mine
I always love you
Till the end of time
Christmas future is far away
Christmas past is past
Christmas present is here today
Bringing joy that may last

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
In a year our troubles will be out of sight
From now on

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
In a year our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Precious friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

I know that
In a year we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Until then, we'll just have to muddle through somehow
And have ourselves a merry little Christmas now.
There's something in the way she moves,

Or looks my way, or calls my name,

That seems to leave this troubled world behind.

If I'm feeling down and blue,

Or troubled by some foolish game,

She always seems to make me change my mind.


Chorus:

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,

She's around me now

Almost all the time.

And If I'm well you can tell that she's been with me now,

And she's been with me now

Quite a long, long time

And I feel fine.


Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning,

And I find myself convening

In places where I should not let me go.

She has the power to go where no one else can find me,

Yes, and to silently remind me

Of the happiness and good times that I know

But I said I just got to know them


It isn't what she's got to say

Or how she thinks or where she's been.

To me, the words are nice, the way they sound.

I like to hear them best that way

It doesn't much matter what they mean,

Well she says them mostly just to calm me down.


Chorus:

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,

She's around me now

Almost all the time.

If I'm well you can tell that she's been with me now,

And she's been with me now

Quite a long, long time

Yes, and I feel fine.
All I knew this morning when I woke

Lyrics
Wake up, little darling
It`s time to go home
If sunrise catch us sleeping
We`ll be caught up in the wrong

Last time we were together
You made it home in
Just the nick of time
We got so much love between us
It`s getting hard to meet the deadline

We`re getting careless with our love
We`re getting careless with our love
So careless with our love affair

Wake up, little darling
Because time, it won`t stand still
Going home to someone
You don`t love no more
I know it`s against your will

I hate to see you leave
With tears all over your face
Just like Sherlock Holmes
The whole world is on my case

We`re getting careless with our love
I can`t help but get careless with our love
We`re getting careless with our love affair

Some people say that it`s wrong
But it`s the only love we know
And it keeps on getting strong

Everytime we see each other
Our love gets a little stronger
That`s why I don`t want you to leave
I wanna hold you a little longer

We`re getting careless with our love
I can`t help but get careless with our love
We`re getting careless with our love affair

Lord, have mercy now
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

I think we better find, I think
We better find another meeting place
Before the whole world is gonna know
We might mess around
And make a disgrace

You see, honey
The rumors are spreading
The rumors are spreading all over town
And we don`t wanna be like Mrs.Jones
We can`t meet at the same place

Every time I see you, baby
I know other folk can see that
Look that we have in our eyes

Yeah, when you see me
You`re supposed to walk on by
But I can feel it in my heart
That we`re getting careless
Careless, careless, careless

We`re getting careless
We`re getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
Careless, careless , yeah

We`re getting careless
Careless, careless, careless
We`re getting so careless......
Watch my back and light my way
My traveling star, my traveling star
Watch over all of those born St. Christopher's Day
Old road dog, young runaway
They hunger for home but they cannot stay
They wait by the door
They stand and they stare
They're already out of there
They're already out of there

My daddy used to ride the rails
So they say, so they say
Soft as smoke and as tough as nails
Boxcar Jones, old walking man
Coming back home was like going to jail
The sheets and the blankets and babies and all
No he never did come back home
Never that I recall

Nevermind the wind,
Nevermind the rain;
Nevermind the road leading home again.
Never asking why,
Never knowing when;
Every now and then
There he goes again.

She had a cat and a dog named Blue
My traveling star, my traveling star
A big old stove and a fireplace, too
Old road dog, young runaway
She told me loved me like it was true
I knew I should stay
I knew I would go
Run run run away
Run run run away, boy

Run before the wind
Run before the rain
Over yonder hill
Just around the bend
Never knowing why
Never knowing when
Every now and then
There you go again

Tie me up and hold me down
Oh, my traveling star
Bury my feet down in the ground
Oh, old road dog
Claim my name from the lost and found
And let me believe this is where I belong
Shame on me for sure
For one more highway song

My traveling star
My traveling star
Well the sun is slowly sinking down
But the moon is surely rising
So this old world must still be spinning around
And I still love you

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes
It's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song when I'm gone

It won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
No one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes
It's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song when I'm gone
There's a ghost in my house
The ghost of your memories
The ghost of the love you took from me

Where our love used to be
Only shadows from the past I see
Time can't seem to erase
The vision of your smiling face
Though you found someone new
I can't get over you
There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
It keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Just keeps on remiding me (ghost in my house)

In my mind I know you're gone
But my heart keeps holding on
To the memories of those happy times
To the love that once was mine
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
You're still such a part of me (ghost in my house)
Still so deep in the heart of me (ghost in my house)


I just keep hearing your footsteps on the stairs
When I know there's no-one there
Every day I love you more
So much more than the day before

Sittin' in my easy chair
I feel your fingers running through my hair
Lookin' down in my coffee cup
I think I see your face lookin' up
All alone in my gloom
You voice echoes through the room
There's a ghost in my house
And I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
It keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Just keeps on reminding me (ghost in my house)

I just keep hearing your footsteps on the stairs
When I know there's no-one there
You're still such a part of me (ghost in my house)
Still so deep in the heart of me (ghost in my house)
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
(fade)
Well the sun is slowly sinking down
But the moon is surely rising
So this old world must still be spinning around
And I still love you

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes
It's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song when I'm gone

It won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
No one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes
It's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song when I'm gone
Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
darling I know, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

(repeat chorus)

ohhhhhh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah

(repeat chorus)

oh yeah

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
Every guy I know
Trying to get ahead
Working two jobs
Til you're almost dead
(You tell em)

Work your fingers
Right down to the bone
There's a cat named Jody
Sneaking around in your home

There's a cat named Jody
In every town
Spending lots of cash
And just riding around

Ride on, Jody
Ride on, ride on
With your bad self
Jody

The ashes in your ashtray
Footprints on your carpet
While you work all day
He even got the nerve
To sleep in your bed
Sit down at the table
Eat your bread

When you get home
After working hard all day
Jody's got your girl
Top40db.com
Top40db.net
Top40db.org.
And he don't play

I said
Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone

(It ain't no sense in going home)
(You gotta get home but
You work too hard)
(It ain't no sense in going home)
(You gotta get home but
You work too hard)

Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone)
I tell you, Jody's got
Your girl and gone
(Ain't no sense in going home)

When you discover
Your gross neglect
Itll be too late to
Give your woman respect

You'll hunt down Jody ?
Ten thousand dollar reward
For Jody's hide

Ain't no sense in going home
Jody's got your girl and gone.....
Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that no one knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say
Hey by the way


You're beautiful
Every little piece love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope you're life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it don't
Stay beautiful


If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
at least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh but if it don't

Will you stay beautiful...beautiful ah bea-ti-ful
Beautiful ah bea-ti-ful beautiful

Oh if it dont
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
cause I'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though I'm not the only one
who feels the way I do.

CHORUS
I'm alone, On my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
and I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine.
could you tell me what more do I need
and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
but that's ok

REPEAT CHORUS
maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
but I'm ready to fly..

I'm alone, On my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
OH I'm alone, On my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl,
Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl
I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure

Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight i really need to know

CHORUS
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really love or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion's so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
This message you're sending

Body to body, soul to soul
Always feel you near
So say the words I long to hear

CHORUS

Love...love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No...I can't let you go...

CHORUS

Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell me from the stars
Tell it to my heart

Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

CHORUS (until fade)
Little one done run out of money now
No, it doesn't seem to have a home
Left to fend for yourself in the wilderness
Out there living life all alone

Whenever you're ready
You could see a dream come true
Whenever you're ready
I'm just saying it's up to you
Whenever you're ready
Things could start looking up
Whenever you're ready
Take a big sip from the loving cup

Making that face carved out of stone
Coping real hard with a losing hand
Sound of a dog choking on a chicken bone
It just can't be the way that you had things planned, my friend

Whenever you're ready, yeah yeah
Things could start to happen real fast
Whenever you're ready, my good friend
Sure we could get one built to last
Whenever you're ready
Oh we could get it done today
Whenever you're ready
Sure enough you could come out and play

Cold, hot, ready or not
Whatever you've got
What have you got to lose, my good friend?

Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready, my good friend
{repeat}
