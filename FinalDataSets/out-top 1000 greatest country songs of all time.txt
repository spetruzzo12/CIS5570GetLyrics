Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair.
Last one to know, last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise, and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champange
And I toasted you, said "Honey we may be through,
But you'll never hear me complain...

chorus:
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be OK.
And I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
So I've got friends... in low places!

Well, I guess I was wrong,
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
and I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then,
Well I'll be as high as that ivory tower
that you're living in

'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be OK.
And I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
So I've got friends... in low places!
Lookin' back,
On the memory of
The dance we shared,
Bebeath the stars above
And for a moment,
All the world was right
But how could I have known,
That you'd ever say goodbye?

And now,
I'm glad I didn't know
The way It all would end
The way It all would go
Our lives,
Are better left to chance
I could've missed the pain,
But I'd of had to miss the dance.

Holding you,
I held everything
And for a moment,
Wasn't I a king?
But If I'd only known,
How the king would fall
Hey who's to say,
You know I might have changed it all

And now,
I'm glad I didn't know
The way It all would end
The way It all would go
Our lives,
Are better left to chance
I could've missed the pain,
But I'd of had to miss the dance

Yes my life,
It's better left to chance
I could've missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss
The dance
He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.

I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.

(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.

(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...

(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd verse, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th verse ''I went to see my
friend today may be found saying ''I went to see him just today'')
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, and yet I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bittersweet memories
That's all I have, and I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't you cry
Cause we both know, I'm not what you need

But, I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life (I hope life)
Treats you kind (treats you kind)
And I hope you have all you dream of
I wish you joy (I wish you joy)
And happiness (and happiness)
But above all this, I wish you love, oh

And I will always love you
I will always love you
Yes, I will always love you
I will always love you
Crazy
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue
I knew
You'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day
You'd leave me for some-body new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry?
Wondering
What in the world did I do...

Oh, crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you...
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you...
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for love-ing
You...
 Georgia, Georgia,
 The whole day through
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 I'm say Georgia
 Georgia
 A song of you
 Comes as sweet and clear
 As moonlight through the pines

 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you

 I said Georgia,
 Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you

 Georgia,
 Georgia,
 No peace, no peace I find
 Just this old, sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 I said just an old sweet song,
 Keeps Georgia on my mind
COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER
Words and music by Loretta Lynn

Well, I was born a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My daddy worked all night in the Vanleer coal mine
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommie rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommie scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommie's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from sellin' a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah!, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well - the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the mem'ries of a coal miner's daughter.
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, oh be proud of him
'Cause after all he's just a man.
Stand by your man, give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely.
Stand by your man, and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can.
Stand by your man.
Stand by your man, and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can.
Stand by your man.
Love is a burning thing
And It Makes A fiery Ring
Bound By Wild Desire
I Fell Into A Ring Of Fire

CHORUS:
I Fell Into A Burning ring of Fire
I Went Down, Down, down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring of Fire

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire

The Taste Of Love Is Sweet
When Hearts Like Ours Meet
I Fell For You Like A Child
Oh, But The Fire Went Wild

CHORUS
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire

I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
I Went Down, Down, Down
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The Ring Of Fire
The Ring Of Fire
You may think that Im talking foolish
Youve heard that Im wild &amp; Im free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that Im feeling for you always will be
Youre not this time that Im killing
Im no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live this love that I give
Is gonna be yours till the day that I die -- oh baby

Chorus...

Im gonna love you forever, forever &amp; ever amen
As long as old men sit &amp; talk about the weather
As long as old women sit &amp; talk about old men
If you wonder how long Ill be faithfull
Ill be happy to tell you again
Im gonna love you forever &amp; ever, forever &amp; ever amen

They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
But honey, I dont care, Im not in love with your hair
And if it all fell out well Id love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
And people forget things that they knew
But its easy to see its happening to me
Ive already forgotten every woman but you --- oh baby

Chorus......

Just listen to how this song ends
Im gonna love you forever &amp; ever forever &amp; ever
Forever &amp; ever forever &amp; ever amen
(Bobbie Gentry)

I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress that had a split from the side clean
up to my hip
It was red velvet trimmin' and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood

She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
as she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run'd off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
&amp;amp;quot;To thine own self be true&amp;amp;quot;
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you

She said here's your chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down now your Mama's gonna move you uptown.

Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't long 'til I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the street
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
In an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hippocrits
That would call me bad
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had

But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For high on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down, hon
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown

Oh, and I guess she did.
[Kenny Rogers]
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

[Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton]
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something goin' on

[Kenny Rogers]
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication

[Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton]
Honest love we fell needs no conversation
And we ride it together, uh huh,
Making love with each other, uh huh.

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

[Dolly Parton]
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if youv'e got no one
And you just walk in the the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

[Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton]
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

[Dolly Parton]
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never

[Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton]
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

[Kenny Rogers]
Sail away

[Dolly Parton]
Ohhhhh, sail away with me

[Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong

My dark hour
My dark hour, you know it's drivin' me wild

Well, well, I went to see the doctor
And I had my fortune read
And you know the doctor told me
Son you better stay in bed

Who's that comin' down that road
Looks like he's carryin' a heavy load
{??} and he started to say
Want to come with me on my way

My dark hour, mother nature's child
My dark hour, oh, it's drivin' me wild


Well, I went to see the doctor
Just to have my fortune read
Well, well, well, well, well, the doctor told me
Son you better stay in bed

So do you think these sinners will fall
Or do you think they'll survive us all
Well, well, well, well down this road
Won't you help me carry my load

My dark hour, mother nature's child
My dark hour, oh, it's drivin' me wild
On a warm summer's evenin',
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler.
We were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness.
When boredom overtook us,
He began to speak.

He said, "Son, I've made my life
Out of readin' people's faces.
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes.
So if you don't mind my sayin',
I can see you're out of aces,
For a taste of your whiskey,
I'll give you some advice."

So I handed him my bottle,
and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet,
And his face lost all expression.
He said, "If
You're gonna play the game, boy,
You gotta learn to play it right."

You've got to know
When to hold 'em,
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away,
Know when to run.
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done.

Now every gambler knows
The secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep.
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep."

And when he finished speakin',
He turned back toward the window,
Crushed out his cigarette
And faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness,
The gambler he broke even.
And in his final words I found
An ace that I could keep.

You've got to know
When to hold 'em,
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away,
Know when to run.
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done.

You've got to know
When to hold 'em,
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away,
Know when to run.
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done.
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell
Next day I chased her around the playground
'Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes
Check yes or no

Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes
Check yes or no

Do you love me do you wanna be my friend
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes
Check yes or no

Check yes or no

Check yes or no
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
But I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene
Amarillo by mornin'
Up from San Antone
Everything that I've got
Is just what I've got on
When that sun is high
In that Texas sky
I'll be buckin' at the county fair
Amarillo by mornin'
Amarillo I'll be there.

They took my saddle in Houston
Broke my leg in Sante Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend
Somewhere along the way
But I'll be looking for eight
When they pull that gate
And I hope that
Judge ain't blind
Amarillo by mornin'
Amarillo on my mind.

Amarillo by mornin'
Up from San Antone
Everything that I've got
Is just what I've got on
I ain't got a dime
But what I've got is mine
I ain't rich
But Lord, I'm free
Amarillo by mornin'
Amarillo's where I'll be.

Amarillo by mornin'
Amarillo's where I'll be...
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
If tomorrow all my things were gone,
I'd worked for all my life.
And I had to start again,
just my children and my wife.

I'd thank my lucky stars,
to be livin here today.
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom,
and they can't take that away.

And I'm proud to be an American,
where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the man who died,
who gave that right to me.

And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land,
God bless the USA.

From the lakes of Minnesota,
to the hills of Tennessee.
Across the plains of Texas,
From sea to shining sea.

From Detroit down to Houston,
and New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart,
and its time we stand and say.

That I'm proud to be an American,
where at least I know I'm free.
And I wont forget the man who died,
who gave that right to me.

And I gladly stand up,
next to you and defend her still today.
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land,
God bless the USA.

'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land,
God bless the USA.

Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught.

Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute.

Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.

Ya ha
--- Instrumental ---

Well, we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home.

A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!

Somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on
My own-I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyesLord
somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me-somebody to love?

(He works hard) Everyday-I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I`m goin` crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Aw they ain't got no common sense
He's got nobody left to believe in

ooh ooh ooh ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Can anybody find me to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I`m alright, I`m alright
I ain`t gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I`m gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love

Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin everynight when the sun goes down
They got whiskey women music &amp;amp;amp; smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

I've got a good job I work hard for my money
When it's quittin time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck &amp;amp;amp; let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie


Yeah, heel, toe, docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin
Cadilac black jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie

The bartender asks me says son what'll it be
I want a shot at that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floors hoppin' &amp;amp;amp; it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, inlaws crooks &amp;amp;amp; straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie

Yeah, heel, toe, docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin
Cadilac black jack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie

I hear the train a comin'
it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....
Hello Darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time
You're just as lovely
As you used to be.

How's your new love
Are you happy
Hope your doin' fine
Just to know it
Means so much to me.

What's that Darlin'
How am I doin'
Guess I'm doin' alright
Except I cant sleep
And I cry all night 'til dawn.

What I'm trying to say
Is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry
That I did you wrong.

Look up Darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time sake
Let me hold you
In my arms one more time.

Thank you Darlin'
May God bless you
And may each step you take
Bring you closer
To the things you seem to find.

Goodbye Darlin'
Gotta go now
Gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories
Of a love so warm and true.

And if you should ever find it
In your heart to forgive me
Come back Darlin'
I'll be waitin' for you...
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance,
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin',
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter,
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.

I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
I hope you dance....I hope you dance.
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone.)

I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There'll be a lotta of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting caught with letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I don't really mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

A long time ago
Even now in my arms
You still want him I know
But darling this time
Let your memories die
When you hold me tonight
Don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes
Let it be me
Don't pretend it's him
In some fantasy
Darling just once
Let yesterday go
You'll find more love
Than you've ever known
Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Maybe I've been a fool
Holding on all this time
Lyin' here in your arms
Knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping some day
That you'll see the light
Let it be me tonight

Three thirty in the morning
Not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town
On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm moving in
He's headin' back from somewhere
that he never shoud have been
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

Every light is burnin'
In a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone
In her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle
Hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather
That's kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls
And the lightning strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

She's waitin' by the window
When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls
And the lightning strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

(Third Verse only done in concert)
She runs back down the hallway
Through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again
'Cause tonight will be the last time
She'll wonder where he's been

The thunder rolls

Back through the years
I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fog
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for me
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes

Chorus:
Oh, play me some mountain music,
Like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway.

Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn.
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreamin' again.

Chorus
Oh, play me some mountain music,
Like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway.

Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man.
Spend the day bein' lazy, just bein' nature's friend.
Climb a long tall hick'ry. Bend it over, skinnin' cats.
Playin' baseball with chert rocks, usin' sawmill slabs for bats.

Bridge:
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart.
Play something with lots of feelin',
'Cause that's where music has to start.

Oh, play me some mountain music,
Like grandma and grandpa used to play.
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway, hey hey.

Oh play me mountain music.
Oh play me mountain music.
Oh play me mountain music.
Oh play me mountain music.
The first thing I remember knowing,
Was a lonesome whistle blowing,
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride;
On a freight train leaving town,
Not knowing where I'm bound,
No-one could change my mind but Mama tried.
One and only rebel child,
From a family, meek and mild:
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store.
Despite all my Sunday learning,
Towards the bad, I kept on turning.
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore.

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole.
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cos Mama tried.

Instrumental break.

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul,
Left my Mom a heavy load;
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes.
Working hours without rest,
Wanted me to have the best.
She tried to raise me right but I refused.

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole.
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on,
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meeting you here today,
To take you to his mansion in the sky?
She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her "baby".
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy,
'Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand,
Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn.
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on.
Then a man of low degree stood by her side,
Promised her he'd take her for his bride.

He said, I was in my early 40's with a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, looking at the X-rays
Talking 'bout the options, and talking 'bout sweet time

I asked him, When it sank in that this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do'

I went skydiving, I went rocky mountain climbing

To live like you were dyin'

He said, I was finally the husband that most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin wasn't such an imposition
And I went 3 times that year I lost my dad
Well I, I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then...

I went skydiving, I went rocky mountain climbing

To live like you were dyin'

Like tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what'd you do with it
What would you do with it?
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?

Skydiving, I went rocky mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying

To live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'
Live like you were dyin'

Johnny's daddy was takin him fishing
When he was eight years old.
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin a fishing pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind
And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson
Take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please- don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Ten years down the road

He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to do
There won't be any harm
And Johnny said
Take my money
Take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please-don't take the girl

Same old boy
Same sweet girl
Five years down the road

There's gonna be a little one
And she says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
Cause his momma's fading fast
And Johnny hit his knees
And there he prayed
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place
If you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please-don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishing
When he was eight years old...
The way you touch, mmm
The way you kiss, ah yeah
Girl you know you know

Alright

You're like nobody else
What can I do?

I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet
You walk by, and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me, too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces

(I fall to pieces)
Each time someone speaks your name

Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too, the way you used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces

Have always been a real close family,

Have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because
I kind of changed my direction
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition

They get on me and want to know Hank
Why do you drink?
Hank why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over
Everybody makes my prediction
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on
An old family tradition

I am very proud
Of my daddy's name
All though his kind of music
And mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over
Put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition

Don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk
And some ole slick's trying to give me friction
I'll say leave me alone
I'm singing all night long
It's a family tradition

Lord I have loved some ladies
And I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973.
When that doctor asked me,
Son how did you get in this condition?
I said, hey sawbones,
I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition

So don't ask me,
Hank why do you drink?
Hank, why do roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Stop and think it over,
Try and put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, its a family tradition!
My baby, he don't talk sweet,
he ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway

And maybe he don't dress fine
But i don't really mind
'cuz every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer:

CHORUS
Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand.
Let's hear it for my baby,
You know you gotta understand.
Oh, maybe he's no Romeo,
But he's my love and one man show.
Whoawhoawhoawhoa
Let's hear it for the boy.

My baby may not be rich,
He's watchin' every dime.
But he loves me loves me loves me,
We always have a real good time.
And maybe he sings off key,
But that's alright by me, yeah.
'Cause what he does he does so well,
Makes me wanna yell.

'Cause every time he pulls me near,
I just wanna cheer.

Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?
How's about cooking somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby - don't you think maybe
We can find us a brand new recipe?

I got a hot rod Ford, and a two dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancing's free
So if you wanna have fun, come along with me

Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?
How's about cooking somethin' up with me?

I'm free and ready, so we can go steady.
How's about saving all your time for me?
No more lookin' - I know I been cookin'
Hows about keepin' steady company?

I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence
And buy me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it till it's covered with age
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page

Say hey, good lookin' - what ya got cookin'?
How's about cooking somethin' up with me?
Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee by-way,
One arm on the wheel.
Holdin' my lover with the other,
A sweet, soft, southern thrill.
Worked hard all week; got a little jingle,
On a Tennessee Saturday night.
Couldn't feel better, I'm together,
With my Dixieland Delight.

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler,
'Neath the mountain moonlight.
Hold her up tight,
Make a little lovin',
A little turtle dovin'.
On a Mason-Dixon night.
Fits my life, oh so right,
My Dixieland Delight.

--- Instrumental ---

White-tail buck deer, munchin' on clover,
Red-tail hawk sittin' on a limb.
A chubby old groundhog, croakin' bullfrog,
Free as the feelin' in the wind.
Home grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl,
On a Tennessee Saturday night.
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven,
With my Dixieland Delight.

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler,
'Neath the mountain moonlight.
Hold her up tight, make a little lovin',
A little turtle dovin'.
On a Mason-Dixon night.
Fits my life, oh so right,
My Dixieland Delight.

--- Instrumental ---

Rollin' down a backwoods Tennessee by way,
One arm on the wheel.
Holdin' my lover...
Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to ma and me,
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze.

Now I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid,
But the meanest thing that he ever did,
Was before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke,
An' it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks,
Seems I had to fight my whole life through.

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red,
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame.

But I made me a vow to the moon and stars,
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars,
And kill that man that gave me that awful name.

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July,
and i'd just hit town and my throat was dry,
thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.

In and old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table dealin' stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad,
from a worn out picture that my mother had,
and I knew that scar on his cheek &amp; his evil eye.

He was big and bent and grey and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said,
"My name is Sue! how do you do! Now you gonna die!"
Yeah that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes,
And he went down but to my surprise,
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece o' my ear.

I busted a chair right across his teeth,
And we crashed through the wall and into the street,
Kickin' and a gougin' in the the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men,
but I really can't remember when,
he kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.

Well I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, "Son, this world is rough,
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough,
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along.

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye,
I knew you'd have to get tough or die,
And it's that name that helped to make you strong.

Now you just fought one hell of a fight,
And I know you hate me and ya got the right,
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do.

But you oughtta thank me before I die,
For the gravel in your gut and the spit in your eye,
'Cause I'm the son of a bitch that named you Sue."

yeah, what could I do, what COULD I do?
Well I got choked up and threw down my gun,
Called him my pa and he called me his son,
And I come away with a different point of view.

I think about him now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,
And if I ever have a son,
I think I'm gonna name him,
Bill or George anything but Sue!
I still hate that name!
(Ronnie Dunn)

I'm a hard workin' man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm gettin' really good at barely gettin' by

Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue collar roots
I feel like I'm workin' overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain

Chorus:
I'm a hard, hard workin man
I got it all on the line
For a peace of the promised land
I'm burnin' my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire goin'
Is to outrun the wind

Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday mornin' I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothin' but business from nine till five

(Repeat chorus)

I can't wait to get up in the mornin'
And do it all over again
Well I'm a hard livin', hard workin' man
Instrumental
Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much, if so, there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who is marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around the scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me, there's something going wrong around here
Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone... yeah

getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
and I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
and I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

in a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

it's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
she said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
it's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and see
hey mister give me two give me two now cos any two can play

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl

another hustle just to make it big
and walkaway walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids

she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
she put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
and in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

and now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
in any shooting gallery where promises are made
to walkaway walkaway
to walkaway walkaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry

Words and music by Hank Williams


Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Every time our eyes meet
This feelin' inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh, it feels like the first time everytime
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh, every little thing that you do
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow. (Hah!)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how,

'Cos I'm goin' to Jackson.

"Goodbye," that's all she wrote.

All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And ol' George Jones I'm glad to see is finally gettin' straight
And Waylon's stayin' home and lovin' Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
[Mandolin - fiddle - steel]
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to do
And cornbread and ice tea's took the place of pills and ninety proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah and I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris he is a movie star and he's moved off to LA
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah me and my rowdy friends done right it on down
Just the other night
At a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into
My old highschool flame
And as I introduced them
The past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of
The way things used to be

She was the one
That I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin'
That God would make her mine
And if He'd only granted me
This wish I'd wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God
For unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin'
To the man upstairs
That just because He doesn't answer
Doesn't mean He don't care!
Some of God's greatest gifts are
unanswered prayers...!

She wasn't quite the angel
That I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me,
And her eyes too, it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows
What He's doing after all

And as she walked away
Well I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God
For unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin'
To the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer
Doesn't mean He don't care!
Some of Gods greatest gifts
are unanswered....
Some of Gods greatest gifts
are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are
Unanswered Prayers!
I go out walkin'
After midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin'

Along the high-way
Well thats just my way
Of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin'

I stop to see a weapin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe hes cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go a walkin'
After midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be
Somewere a walkin'
After midnight

When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world turns blue

There's a rundown bar
Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of this neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
The words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
This hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes
I spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep

(CHORUS)
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My mamma and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'till that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

I gotta wash my truck
And dress up
Pick her up to watch TV
When she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
Our love is unconditional, we knew it from the start.
I see it in your eyes, you can feel it from my heart.
From here on after let's stay the way we are right now,
And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow.

Chorus:
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine.

You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete,
And as long as there's a breath in me,
I'll make yours just as sweet.
As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see,
So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be.

Chorus:
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine.

And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm,
You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm.
In all the world you'll never find a love as true as mine,
A love as true as mine...
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
Well, excuse me, but I think you've got my chair.
No, that one's not taken; I don't mind if you sit here.
I'll be glad to share.
Yeah, it's usually packed here on Friday nights.
Oh, if you don't mind, could I talk you out of a light?
Well, thank you, could I drink you a buy?
Oh, listen to me. What I mean is can I buy you a drink?
Anything you please.
Oh, you're welcome. Well, I don't think I caught your name.
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here?
Well, that makes two of us, glad you came.
No, I don't know the name of the band.
But they're good, aren't they?
Would you like to dance?
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me, baby.
Do you think there's a chance that later on I could drive you home?
No, I don't mind at all.
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth,
That wasn't my chair after all.
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth,
That wasn't my chair after all.

That wasn't my chair after all (fades out).
I remember wearin' straight leg Levis
Flannel shirts Even when they weren't in style
I remember singin' with Roy Rogers
at the movies when the West was really wild

And I was listenin' to the Opry
When all of my friends
were diggin' Rock 'n Roll and Rhythm &amp; Blues
I was Country, when Country wasn't cool

I remember circlin' the drive-in,
pullin' up and turnin' down George Jones
I remember when no one was lookin'
I was puttin' peanuts in my Coke

I took a lot of kiddin'
'Cause I never did fit in
now look at everybody
tryin' to be what I was then

I was Country, when Country wasn't cool
Oooh

(Chorus:)
I was Country, when Country wasn't cool
I was Country, from my hat down to my boots
I still act, and look the same
What you see ain't nothin' new

I was Country, when Country wasn't cool

(Instrumental Break)

They call us country bumpkins
For stickin' to our roots
I'm just glad we're in a country
Where we're all free to choose

I was Country, when Country wasn't cool

(George Jones)
Hey I was Country, when Country wasn't cool
Yeah I was country, from my hat down to, Whoa my boots
I still act, and look the same
What you see ain't nothin' new

Yeah, I was Country when Country wasn't cool
Right now he’s probably slow dancing with a bleached blonde tramp, and she’s probably getting frisky
Right now he’s probably buying her some fruity little drink ‘cause she can’t shoot whiskey
Right now he’s probably up behind her with a pool stick showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don’t know

'''I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he’ll think before he cheats'''

Right now she’s probably up singing some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she’s probably saying, "I’m drunk," and he’s a-thinking that he’s gonna get lucky
Right now he’s probably dabbing on three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don’t know

I'll bet you never heard ol' Marshall Dillon say
Miss Kitty have you ever thought of runnin' away
Or settlin' down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please

She'd of said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss, as he rode away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place

Chorus:
I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
(I'd be) wearin' my six-shooter
Ridin' my pony on the cattle drive
Stealin' the young girl's hearts


Just like Gene and Roy
Singin' those camp fire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I might have had a side-kick with a funny name
Runnin' wild through the hills chasin' Jesse James
Or ending up on the brink of danger
Ridin' shot-gun for the Texas rangers

Go west young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleepin' all night, beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

Repeat Chorus
Repeat Chorus
Who doesn't know what I'm talking about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes

As her folks drive away, her dad yells, "check the oil"
Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leaving my girl"
She said it didn't seem like a-that long ago
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needed wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)
He was working through college on my grandpa's farm.
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car. (yeah)
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child.
When one restless summer we found love growing wild.
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path.
It's funny how those memories they last.
Like strawberry wine and seventeen.
The hot July moon saw everything.
My first taste of love oh bittersweet.
The green on the vine.
Like strawberry wine.

I still remember when thirty was old.
My biggest fear was September when he had to go.
A few cards and letters and one long distance call.
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall.
But year after year I come back to this place.
Just to remember the taste.
Of strawberry wine and seventeen.
The hot July moon saw everything.
My first taste of love oh bittersweet.
The green on the vine.
Like strawberry wine.

The fields have grown over now.
Years since they've seen the plow.
There's nothing time hasn't touched.
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence.
I've been missing so much.... yeaaaaaa
.....Strawberry wine and seventeen.
The hot July moon saw everything.
My first taste of love oh bittersweet.
The green on the vine.
Like strawberry wine.

seventeen......
The hot July moon saw everything.
My first taste of love oh bittersweet.
The green on the vine.
Like strawberry wine....

strawberry wine....
ohhhhhhh.....
strawberry wine....
I thumbed my way from LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights aint where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams I'm comin' home
But tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe'
He said that he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her!
Can you make these big wheels burn?

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I can't blame her for lettin' go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain runnin' down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes!

Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain
Well, mama killed a chicken,
Thought it was a duck
Put him on the table with his legs stickin' up
You gotta bundle up and go, yeah
You gotta bundle up and go
Well, ya high pile o' women
Sho' gotta bundle up and go

May be old, may be grey, you ain't too old just to shift them gears,
You gotta bundle up and go

Well, you high pile o' women sho gotta bundle up and go
If I could grant you one wish
I wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you baby
When you're driving me, ooh, crazy

chorus:
Ooh, I love the way you, love the way you love me
There's no where else I'd rather be
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Love me, ooh, the way you love me

It's not right, it's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you

(Chorus)

You're the million reasons why there's
Love reflecting in my eyes

(chorus til fade)
There only two things in life that make it worth livin'
That's guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
I don't need my name in the marquis lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love

Chorus:
Let's go to Luckenbach Texas with Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us fueding
like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams pain songs, Newberry's train songs
and blue eyes cryin' in the rain out in Luckenbach Texas
ain't nobody feelin' no pain

So baby let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high socitey you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maby it's time we got back to the basics of love

Chorus:
Let's go to Luckenbach Texas with Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us fueding
like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams pain songs, Newberry's train songs
and blue eyes cryin' in the rain out in Luckenbach Texas
ain't nobody feelin' no pain

Let's go to Luckenbach Texas with Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us fueding
like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams pain songs, Jerry Jeff's train songs
and blue eyes cryin' in the rain out in Luckenbach Texas
ain't nobody feelin' no pain
I said I want to touch the earth
I want to break it in my hands
I want to grow something wild and unruly
I want to sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me

I said, cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you

I want to walk and not run
I want to skip and not fall
I want to look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I want to be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you

I said I want to touch the earth
I want to break it in my hands
I want to grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you
Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again
And here I go
Here I go
And here I go
Here I go
 Georgia, Georgia,
 The whole day through
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 I'm say Georgia
 Georgia
 A song of you
 Comes as sweet and clear
 As moonlight through the pines

 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you

 I said Georgia,
 Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you

 Georgia,
 Georgia,
 No peace, no peace I find
 Just this old, sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 I said just an old sweet song,
 Keeps Georgia on my mind
If you leave me
I won't miss you
And I won't ever take you back
Girl your memory
Won't ever haunt me
Cause I don't love you
Now if you'll buy that

I've got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I've got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free

I don't worship
The ground you walk on
I never have and that's a fact
I won't follow or try to find you
Cause I don't love you
Now if you'll buy that

I've got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I've got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free

I've got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
I've got some ocean front property in Arizona
If you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free

Yeah if you'll buy that I'll throw the Golden Gate in free
In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain.

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In the land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain.
A long time forgotten
are dreams that just felt by the way.
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living to day.
But she never complains of
the bad times or bad things he's done
Lord.
She's just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come.

She's a good hearted woman
in love with a good timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
that she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass though his world hand in hand.
A good hearted woman
lovin' her good timin' man.

He likes the night life
the brightlights and good timin' friends.
when the party's all over
she welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him
but she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good hearted woman
she loves her good timin' man.

She's a good hearted woman ...
She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It would been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way to fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was sooo scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this all on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
To save me from this road I'm on

Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, why, oh
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee;
We don't take no trips on LSD
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street;
We like livin' right, and bein' free.

I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all

We don't make a party out of lovin';
We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy,
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do.

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball.
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear;
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen.
Football's still the roughest thing on campus,
And the kids here still respect the college dean.

We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,

I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road

Third boxcar midnight train, destination Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found, short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road

I know every engineer on every train
All the children and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no-one's around
I sing...

Trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes

As the midnight moon, was drifting through
The lazy sway of the trees,
I saw the look in your eye, looking into the night
Not seeing what you wanted too see
Darling don't say a word, I've already heard,
What your body is saying to mine,
You’ve got a fast move, you got a slow groove, on your mind

You want a man with a slow hand, you want a lover with an easy touch
You want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
Baby, believe me, I understand, when it comes to love
You want a slow hand

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Tears fill my eyes 'till I can't see

3 o'clock in the mornin, here am I
Sitting here so lonely, so lonesome I could cry

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?

Now that it's over, I realize
Those weak words you wispered, were nothing but lies
Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?

Why can't you be blue, over me?

My Maria don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her
When she's around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

Maria, Maria I love you

My Maria there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind
Gypsy lady you're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

My Maria
Maria I love you
My Maria
Maria I love you

My Maria
Maria I love you
I’m going out tonight - I’m feeling alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise - really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

No inhibitions - make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain’t gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

The best thing about bein’ a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun

Oh, oh, oh go totally crazy - forget I’m a lady
Men’s shirts - short skirts
Oh, oh, oh really go wild - yeah, doin’ my style
Oh, oh, oh get in the action - feel the attraction
Color my hair - do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh I wanna be free - yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like I woman!

The girls need a break - tonight we’re gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don’t need romance - we only wanna dance
We’re gonna let our hair hang down

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun

Oh, oh, oh go totally crazy - forget I’m a lady
Men’s shirts - short skirts
Oh, oh, oh really go wild - yeah, doin’ my style
Oh, oh, oh get in the action - feel the attraction
Color my hair - do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh I wanna be free - yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like I woman!

I get totally crazy
Can you feel it
Come, come, come on baby
I feel like a woman
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd

'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say "I want you"

She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me

'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
It was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride.
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard, anymore.
Even though your on my fightin' side.

CHORUS
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain.
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me by my name.

I've heard my name a few times in your phone book
I've seen it on signs where I've laid
But the only time I know, I'll hear David Allan Coe
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day.

CHORUS...

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
and he told me it was the perfect country and western song.
I wrote him back a letter and told him it was NOT the perfect
country and western song because he hadn't said anything about
Momma, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk.

Well, he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent
it to me and after reading it, I realized that my friend had written
the perfect country and western song. And I felt obliged to include it
on this album.

The last verse goes like this here:

Well, I was drunk the day my Mom got outta prison.
And I went to pick her up in the rain.
But, before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
She got runned over by a damned old train.

CHORUS
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me
And I never minded standin' in the rain. No,
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even call me, I wonder why you don't call me
Why don't you ever call me by my name.
I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be.
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free.
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time.
I never thought that I would get caught.
It seemed like a perfect crime.

Baby, you left me defenseless,
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

I thought it would be so simple,
Like a thousand times before.
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away.
But I never made it to the door.
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy.
Go ahead and throw the book at me.
If lovin' you's a crime,
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree...
I know Seymour's the greatest,
But I'm dating a semi-sadist.
So I got a black eye,
and my arm's in a cast.

Still that Semour's a cutie.
Well, if not, he's got inner beauty.
And I dream of a place,
Where we can be together, at last.

A matchbox of our own.
A fence of real chainlink.
A grill out on the patio.
Disposal in the sink.
A washer and a dryer,
And an ironing-machine.
In a tract house that we share,
Somewhere that's green.

He rakes and trims the grass.
He loves to mow and weed.
I cook like Betty Crocker,
And I look like Donna Reed.
There's plastic on the furniture
To keep it neat and clean.
In the Pine-Sol scented air,
Somewhere that's green.

Between our frozen dinner,
and our bed-time nine-fifteen.
We snuggle watching Lucy,
On a big, enormous, twelve-inch screen.

Oh, his December bride,
He's father, he knows best.
The kids play Howdy-Doody,
As the Sun sets in the West.
A picture out of Better Homes
And Gardens magzine.
Far from Skid Row,
I dream we'll go...
Somewhere that's Green.
[David Allan Coe]

(Chorus)
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin' here no more
Woman done left
Took all the reason
I was working for
Ya, better not try to stand in my way
As I'm walkin', out that door
You can take this job and shove it
I ain't working here no more

Well, I been working in this factory
For now on fifteen years
All this time, I watched my woman
Drownin' in a pool of tears
And I've seen alot of good folks die
Who had alot of bills to pay
I'd give the shirt right off of my back
If I had the guts to say...

(Chorus)

The foreman, he's a regular dog
The line boss, he's a fool
He got a flat top haircut
Lord, the boy thinks he's cool
One of these days
I'm gonna blow my top
And that sucker, he's gonna pay
I can't wait
Until I get the nerve
To walk up to him and say...

(Chorus)

Take this job and shove it
Lyrics:
Unchain my heart, baby let me be
Unchain my heart 'cause you don't care about me
You've got me sewed up like a pillow case
but you let my love go to waste so
Unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

Unchain my heart, baby let me go
Unchain my heart, 'cause you don't love me no more
Ev'ry time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home so
Unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

I'm under your spell like a man in a trance
But I know darn well, that I don't stand a chance so
Unchain my heart, let me go my way
Unchain my heart, you worry me night and day
Why lead me through a life of misery
when you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart, oh please, please set me free

In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her she said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after what-ever the other life brings

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
Had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille

After he left us I ordered more whisky
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her 'cos the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille ....
J5:Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it!

Michael: When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It.
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit.

When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing!

CHORUS:
Stop! The love you save may be your own!

Second verse:
Michael: Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benjie held your hand he felt
E-lec-tri-ci-tee!
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chimes.
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your times!


CHORUS:
Stop! The love you save may be your own!

Darling(fades)
Well I've heard those city singers singin 'bout how they can love
Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars above
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall
But that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I have to sing this song about all the things I knew

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill

From the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
So this is just another way of sayin' the same thing

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill

My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the rivers
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill
Lady...
I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you.
You have made me what I am and I am yours.
My love...
There's so many ways I want to say, �I love you.�
Let me hold you in my arms forever more.

You have gone and made me such a fool.
I �m so lost in your love.
And oh, we belong together.
Won't you believe in my song?
Lady...
For so many years, I thought I'd never find you.
You have come into my life and made me whole.
Forever, let me wake to see you each and every morning.
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear.
In my eyes, I see no one else but you.
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes I'll always want you near me.
I've waited for you for so long.
Lady...
Your love�s the only love I need.
and Beside me is where I want you to be.
Cause my love there's something I want you to know.
You're the love of my life. You're my lady...
getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
and I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
and I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

in a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

it's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
she said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
it's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and see
hey mister give me two give me two now cos any two can play

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
money for muscle and another girl I dig
another hustle just to make it big
and walkaway walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids

she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
she put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
and in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

and now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
in any shooting gallery where promises are made
to walkaway walkaway
to walkaway walkaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
and I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
Mama was proud and she stood her ground
she knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered some folks talked
but everybody looked the other way
when time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day

CHORUS:
Let Freedom ring,let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today is a
Day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay, it's
Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames,
and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I ain’t sayin' it's right or it's wrong
but maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Repeat Chorus

Roll the stone away
It's Independence Day
This ol' highway's gettin' longer
Seems there ain't no end in sight
To sleep would be best, but I just can't afford to rest
I've got to ride in Denver tomorrow night.

I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me, to tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holdin' on this long.

Chorus:
And the white line's gettin' longer, and the saddle's gettin' cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old.

The competition's gettin' younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
The worn out tape of Chris LeDoux, lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all.

Chorus:
And the white line's gettin' longer, and the saddle's gettin' cold
I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table with no ace left in the hole
I'm much too young to feel this damn old.

Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old.
Now here I am again in this mean old town,
And you're so far away from me.
Now where are you when the sun goes down,
You're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Alright.

I'm tired of being in love and being all alone,
When you're so far away from me.
I'm tired of making out on the telephone,
Cause you're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Alright.

And I get so tired when I have to explain,
That you're so far away from me.
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain,
And you're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Check it out.

So far away.
You're so far away from me.
(You're so far.)
Alright.
(You're so far.)
Yes, you're so far away from me.
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm,
I should have listened to my old man.

You know you can't hold me forever,
I didn't sign up with you.
I'm not a present for your friends to open,
This boy's too young to be singing the blues.

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.
You can't plant me in your penthouse,
I'm going back to my plough.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.
You can't plant me in your penthouse,
I'm going back to my plough.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
(Travis Tritt)

You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone
Now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared
And you say you'd be happy if I you could just come back home
Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen, or might give a damn
Maybe one of your sorted affairs
But don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lies
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares



Girl, I thought what we had could never turn bad
So your leavin' caught me unaware
But the fact is you've run...girl, that can't be undone
So here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Call someone who'll listen, or might give a damn
Maybe one of your sorted affairs
But don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lies
Here's a quarter, call someone who cares

Yeah, here's a quarter, call someone who cares
Daddy won a radio
He tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me
She taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries cause she never thought
I'd really ever take it this far
Singin� in the bars

CHORUS:
And chasin� that neon rainbow
Livin� that honky tonk dream
Cause all I've ever wanted
Is to pick this guitar and sing
It's time to be somebody
Just wanna be heard and sing
I'm chasin� that neon rainbow
Livin� that honky tonk dream

And it was at a coffee cup
Five pickers and an old Dodge truck
Headin� down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me
Half the time I sing for free
When the crowd�s into it, lord,
It makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight

CHORUS

Now daddy�s got a radio
He won it thirty years ago
He said; son I just know
We're gonna hear you singin� on it some day
I made it up to music row
Lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

CHORUS
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like this worlds gone crazy
Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
When the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other, come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Woah oh, grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days

Grandpa, everything is changing fast
We call it progress, but I just don't know
And grandpa, Let's wander back into the past
And paint me the picture of long ago

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Woah oh, grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Woah oh, grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Whenever I chance to meet
some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And everytime they ask me why
I just smile and say

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
and let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
but some of them never learn it's a simple thing

The secret i'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
and the answer is in this song
that i always sing

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
and let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil when you get back home

Kiss an angel good morning
and let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
and love her like the devil when you get back home
It's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
We've been the same way for years
We need to change

Somebody told me when I got to Nashville
Son you finally got it made
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
I don't think Hank done it this way

Ten years down the road, making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time just so I understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way
Did Ol' Hank really do it this way?

I've seen the world with a five piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way
No I don't think Hank done 'em this a'way

Take it home
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking aloud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes sayin' you'll never leave me
The touch of our hands say you'll catch me if ever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all
Evryone considered him the coward of the county.
Hed never stood one single time to prove the county wrong.
His mama named him tommy, the folks just called him yellow,
But something always told me they were reading tommy wrong.

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison.
I looked after tommy cause he was my brothers son.
I still recall the final words my brother said to tommy:
Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun.

Promise me, son, not to do the things Ive done.
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It wont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek.
I hope youre old enough to understand:
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.

Theres someone for evryone and tommys love was becky.
In her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man.
One day while he was workin the gatlin boys came callin.
They took turns at becky.... there was three of them!

Tommy opened up the door and saw his becky cryin.
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddys picture.
As his tears fell on his daddys face, he heard these words again:

Promise me, son, not to do the things Ive done.
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It wont mean youre weak if you turn the other cheek.
I hope youre old enough to understand:
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.

The gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom.
One of them got up and met him halfway cross the floor.
When tommy turned around they said, hey look! ol yellows leavin.
But you coulda heard a pin drop when tommy stopped and blocked the door.

Twenty years of crawlin was bottled up inside him.
He wasnt holdin nothin back; he let em have it all.
When tommy left the barroom not a gatlin boy was standin.
He said, this ones for becky, as he watched the last one fall.
And I heard him say,

I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done.
I walk away from trouble when I can.
Now please dont think Im weak, I didnt turn the other cheek,
And papa, I sure hope you understand:
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man.

Evryone considered him the coward of the county.
(T.Shapiro/R.Rutherford)

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry,
The way you move when you walk by
There's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you)
That don't do something for me

The way you look, the way you laugh,
The way you love with all you have,
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

The way you talk, the way you tease
Right now I think you see
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me

If You're Gonna Play In Texas (You Gotta Have A Fiddle In The Band)
(Dan Mitchell/Murray Kellum)

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for &amp;amp;quot;Louisiana Man&amp;amp;quot;
So rosin up that bow for &amp;amp;quot;Faded Love&amp;amp;quot; and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band

I remember down in Houston we were puttin' on a show
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled, &amp;amp;quot;Cotton-Eyed Joe&amp;amp;quot;!
He said, &amp;amp;quot;We love what you're doin', boys don't get us wrong
There's just somethin' missin' in your song&amp;amp;quot;

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for &amp;amp;quot;Louisiana Man&amp;amp;quot;
So rosin up that bow for &amp;amp;quot;Faded Love&amp;amp;quot; and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band

So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight
Them Texans raised the roof when Jeff opened up his case
You say y'all all wanna two-step
You say ya wanna doe-si-doe
Well, here's your fiddlin' song before we go

If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band
That lead guitar is hot but not for &amp;amp;quot;Louisiana Man&amp;amp;quot;
So rosin up that bow for &amp;amp;quot;Faded Love&amp;amp;quot; and let's all dance
If you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band

He was on his way home from Candletop,
Been two weeks gone, and he'd thought he'd stop,
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her.
Andy Warlord said: "Hello."
He said "How. What's doin'?"
Wo said: "Sit down, I got some bad news and it's gonna hurt."

He said: "I'm your best friend, and you know that's right,
"But your young bride ain't home tonight.
Since you been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth."
Now he got mad, and he saw red.
Andy said: "Boy, don't you lose your head,
'Cos to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself."

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia.
That's the night that they hung an innocent man.
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southerly lawyer.
'Cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.

Well Andy got scared, and left the bar,
Walkin' on home, 'cos he didn't live far.
You see, Andy didn't have many friends,
And he just lost him one.
Brother thought his wife musta left town,
So he went home and finally found,
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun.

He went off to Andy's house,
Slippin' through the back woods quiet as a mouse.
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make.
He looked through the screen at the back porch door,
And he saw Andy lyin on the floor,
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake.

Georgia patrol was making their rounds,
So he fired a shot just to flag them down.
A big-bellied sherriff grabbed his gun and said "Why'd you do it?"

Judge said guilty on a make-believe trial,
Slapped the sherriff on the back with a smile,
And said: "Supper's waitin' at home, and I gotta get to it."

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia.
That's the night that they hung an innocent man.
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southerly lawyer.
'Cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.

Well, they hung my brother before I could say,
The tracks he saw while on his way,
To Andy's house and back that night were mine.
And his cheatin' wife had never left town,
That's one body that'll never be found.
You see, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun.

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia.
That's the night that they hung an innocent man.
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southerly lawyer.
'Cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia.
That's the night that they hung an innocent man.
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southerly lawyer.
'Cos the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.
His eyes are cold and restless
His wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
She knows his love's in Tulsa
And she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman, flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo

Well, it's balls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

She does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's So long girl, I'll see you
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo

Well, it's balls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo

It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive a man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play her game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo

Well, it's balls and blood
It's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles

He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain

It's the broncs and the blood
It's the steers and the mud
And they call the thing rodeo
Katie's sitting on the old front porch
Watching the chickens peck the ground
There ain't a whole lot going on tonight
In this one horse town.
Over yonder, coming up the road
In a beat-up Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy, he's laying on the horn
Splashing through the mud and the muck

Her daddy says, "he ain't worth a lick
When it came to brains, he got the short end of the stick"
But Katie's young and man she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday

Katie and Tommy at the drive-in movie
Parked in the very last row
They're too busy holding on to one another
To even care about the show
But later on outside the Tastee Freeze,
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says, "my high school ring will have to do
Till I can buy a wedding band"

Her daddy says, "he ain't worth a lick
When it came to brains, he got the short end of the stick"
But Katie's young and man she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday

Her daddy's waiting up till half past twelve
When they come sneaking up the walk
He says, "young lady get on up to your room
While me and junior have a talk"
But Mama breaks in and says, "don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
When you yourself was just a hay-seed plowboy
Who didn't have a row to hoe"

"My daddy said you wasn't worth a lick
When it came to brains, you had the short end of the stick
But he was wrong and honey you are too
Katie looks at Tommy like I still look at you"

She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy

What's meant to be will always find a way
She's gonna marry that boy someday.
She's in love with the boy....
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank god for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Last night I dug your picture out from our old dresser drawer;
I set it on the table and I talked to it til four.
I read some more love letters right up til the break of dawn;
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones.

Well, I went through the jewelry and found our wedding rings;
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling.
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home;
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones.

chorus

I'm diggin' up bones; I'm diggin' up bones.
Exhuming things that's better left alone.
I'm resurrecting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone;
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones.

Well, I went through the closet and found some things in there
Like that pretty neglige that I bought you to wear.
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on;
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones.

repeat chorus

I'm resurreting mem'ries of a love that's dead and gone,
Yeah, tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones.
Well I'm shameless
When it comes to loving you,
I'll do anything you want me to,
I'll do anything at all.

And I'm standing
Here for all the world to see,
Oh, baby that's what's left of me,
I don't have very far to fall.

You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in.
I don't break easy, I have my pride,
But if you need to be satisfied

I'm shameless.
Honey, I don't have a prayer.
Every time I see you standing there
I go down upon my knees.

And I'm changing,
Swore I'd never compromise,
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise.
I'll do anything you please

You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down.
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew,
But I can't walk away from you.

I have never let anything have this much control on me.
I've worked too hard to call my life my own.
And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,
But it's your world now, I can't refuse,
I've never had so much to lose.
Oh I'm shameless...

You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong.
I've never lost anything I ever missed,
But I've never been in love like this.
It's out of my hands.

I'm shameless.
I don't have the power now,
And I don't want it anyhow,
So I gotta let it go.

Why I'm shameless.
Shameless as a man can be.
You could make a total fool of me.
I just wanted you to know
Why I'm shameless.
Mary-Ann and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA

After graduation Mary-Ann went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary-Ann flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die!

(nanana...)
Goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas (nanana...)
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You feelin' weak (nanana...)
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark (nanana...)
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said,
"Thank you ladies if you hear from him let us know"

Well the weeks went by and
spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night
'Cause Earl had to die

(nanana...)
Goodbye Earl
We need a break...........
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch (nanana...)
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well is that all right? (nanana...)
Good!
Let's go for a ride, Earl

Hey! (nanana...)
Oh, hey hey hey! (nanana...)
Aww, hey hey hey! (nanana...)
Well,hey hey hey (nanana...)
Song, Song of the south
sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth

sweet potato pie, and i shut my mouth
gone gone with the wind

but we were so poor that we couldnt tell
the cotton was short, and the weeds was' tall
But Mr. Roosevelt's a' gonna save us all

well momma got sick, and daddy got down
the county got the farm, and we moved to town
poppa got a job with the TVA
we bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet

singing: Song song of the south
sweet potatoe pie, and I shut my mouth
gone, gone with the wind
there aint nobody looking back again
repeat 6 times!
It was 700 fence posts
from your place to ours
Neither one of us was old enough to drive a car
sometimes it was rainin and sometimes it would shine
we wore out that gravel road between your house and mine

Chorus
I start walkin your way you start walkin mine
we meet in the middle neath that old Georgia pine
We gain a lot of ground cuz we both give a little
aint no road to long when we meet in the middle

It's been 7 years tomorrow since we said our vows
under that old pine tree you oughta see it now
standin in the backyard remindin me and you
that if we don't see eye to eye
there's something we can do

Chorus

Babe I love the way we work it out
That's what love is all about

Repeat Chorus 3 times
I don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye

I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye

I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
There's a lot of ways of saying
What I wanna say to you
There's songs and poems and promises
And dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's
Made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing
Little things that turn me on
Like standing in the kitchen
In your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers
I still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

When a whole lot of Decembers
Are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around
And if I can't I know that
I'd still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around...
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

(Chorus)

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

(Repeat Chorus)

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

(Repeat Chorus)

Love and only love
Love and only love
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed the way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blind by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

(Ladies &amp;amp; gentleman Mr. Elton John)
I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal oh

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me
(Mr. Elton John)
I spent last night in the arms
Of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway
My thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles
Callin' Baton Rouge

A replay of last night's events
Roll through my mind
Except a scene or two
Erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead
So I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee
And a couple dollars change
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator won't you put me on through
I gotta' send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up won't you put her on the line
I gotta' talk to the girl just one more time

Hello Samantha dear I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then I'll spend my money up right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge

Operator won't you put me on through
I gotta' send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up won't you put her on the line
I gotta' talk to the girl just one more time

Oh in Baton Rouge
Sweet Baton Rouge, my Baton Rouge
getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
and I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
and I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

in a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

it's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
she said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
it's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and see
hey mister give me two give me two now cos any two can play

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
money for muscle and another girl I dig
another hustle just to make it big
and walkaway walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids

she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
she put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
and in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

and now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
in any shooting gallery where promises are made
to walkaway walkaway
to walkaway walkaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane

Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right

She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is about to kill

She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right

(Wooohooo)

Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend (It’s going down baby)
Look who took you under
She got seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife (It’s going down baby)
Susie's got your number
You know Susie says its right

It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)

And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Ooo...
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

Chorus
Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

(chorus)

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe, just breathe
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again
I've been a rock, and I've got my fences
I never let them down
When it comes to love, I keep my senses
I don't get kicked around
I shivered once
You broke into my soul
The damage is done now
I'm out of control
How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like,
No one could love me like you.
You could make me want you anytime you want to
You're burning me alive
I can't deny you even when I catch you
Weaving a weak alibi
Cause when the night falls
You make me forget
Your love is killing me
And it ain't over yet
How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like,
No one could love me like you.
I shivered once
You broke into my soul
The damage is done now
I'm out of control
How did you get to me?
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like,
No one could love me like...
No one else on earth
Could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like,
No one could love me like you.
No one else on earth
Was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one like you
No one like you.
She loved him like he was
The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come lovin' up on her
Give a little then take it back

She'd tell him about her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry
"You're crazy for believin'
You'll never leave the ground,"
He said. "Only angels know how to fly"

And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly

One Sunday morning
She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly

With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Then you ought to see her fly
Just'a good ol' boys
Never meanin' no harm.
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born

Staightnin' the curves
Flatnin the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em
But the law never will

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow.

Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow.

I'm a good ol' boy
You know my momma loves me
But she don't undestand
They keep a showin my hands and not my face on TV
Eyes that look like heaven, lips like sherry wine
That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine
'Cause I know that my Elvira's mine

So I'm singin'
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire Elvira
Giddy Up Oom Poppa Omm Poppa Mow Mow
Giddy Up Oom Poppa Omm Poppa Mow Mow
Heigh-ho Silver, away

Tonight I'm gonna meet her at the Hungry House Cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can
She's gonna jump and holler 'cause I saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man

Now I'm a singin'
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire Elvira
Giddy Up Oom Poppa Omm Poppa Mow Mow
Giddy Up Oom Poppa Omm Poppa Mow Mow
Heigh-ho Silver, away
It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair,
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbeque stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbeque stain on my white t-shirt
You were killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbeque stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget something like that
Oh, not something like that
You had not've fallen then I would not've found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around awhile
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away for love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
[ guitar ]
Fly on fly on past the speed of sound I'd rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
Mama, I found someone
Like you said would come along
He's a sight, so unlike
Any man I've known
I was afraid to let him in
'Cause I'm not the trustin kind
But now I'm convinced
That he's heaven sent
And must be out of his mind

(Chorus)

Mama, he's crazy
Crazy over me
And in MY life is where he says
He always wants to be
I've never been so LOVED
He beats all I've ever seen
Mama, he's crazy
He's crazy over me

And, Mama, you've always said,
&amp;amp;quot;Better look before you leap&amp;amp;quot;
Maybe so, but here I go
Lettin' my heart lead me.
He thinks I hung the moon and stars
I think he's a livin' dream
Well, there are men
But ones like him
Are few and far between

(Repeat Chorus)
Whiskey River take my mind,
Don't let her mem'ry torture me.
Whiskey River don't run dry,
You're all I've got, take care of me.

Whiskey River take my mind,
Don't let her mem'ry torture me.
Whiskey River don't run dry,
You're all I've got, take care of me.

I'm drowning in a whiskey river,
Bathing my mem'ried mind in the wetness of its soul.
Feeling the amber current flowin' from my mind.
And warm an empty heart you left so cold.

Whiskey River take my mind,
Don't let her mem'ry torture me.
Whiskey River don't run dry,
You're all I've got, take care of me.

Instrumental break.

I'm drowning in a whiskey river,
Bathing my mem'ried mind in the wetness of its soul.
Feeling the amber current flowin' from my mind.
And warm an empty heart you left so cold.

Whiskey River take my mind,
Don't let her mem'ry torture me.
Whiskey River don't run dry,
You're all I've got, take care of me.
Now I lay me down not to sleep.
I just get tangled in the sheets.
I swim in sweat 3 inches deep.
Just lay back and claim defeat.

Chapter read and lesson learned.
I turn the lights off while she burned.
So, while she's three hundred degrees,
I throw the sheets off and I freeze.

Lids down, I count sheep,
I count heartbeats.
The only thing that counts is
That I won't sleep.
I countdown, I look around.

Who needs sleep?
(Well, you're never gonna get it.)
Who needs sleep?
(Tell me what's that for?)
Who needs sleep?
(Be happy with what you're getting,
There's a guy's been awake since the Second World War.)

My hands are locked up tight in fists.
My mind is racing, filled with lists
Of things to do and things I've done.
Another sleepless night's begun.

Lids down, I count sheep,
I count heartbeats.
The only thing that counts is
That I won't sleep.
I countdown, I look around.

Who needs sleep?

So much joy in life, so many pleasures all around.
But the pleasure of insomnia is one I've never found.
With all life has to offer there's so much to be enjoyed.
But the pleasures of insomnia are ones I can't avoid.

Lids down, I count sheep,
I count heartbeats.
The only thing that counts is
That I won't sleep.
I countdown, I look around.

(Tell me what's that for?)
Who needs sleep?
(Be happy with what you're getting,
There's a guy's been awake since the Second World War.)
(Repeat)
I turned on the evenin' news
Saw an old man being interviewed
Turnin' a hundred and two today
They asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his ol' pipe
Laughed and said, 'All I can say is'
Don't blink
Just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growin' like mine did
Turnin' into moms and dads
Next thing you know
Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're prayin' God takes you instead
Trust me friend
A hundred years goes faster than you think
(So) (But) don't blink
I was glued to my TV
When it looked like he looked at me
And said, 'Let's start puttin' first things first'
'Cause when your hourglass runs outta sand
You can't flip it over, start again
Took every breath God gives you, for what it's worth
Don't blink
Just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growin' like mine did
Turnin' into moms and dads
Next thing you know
Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're prayin' God takes you instead
Trust me friend
A hundred years goes faster than you think
(So) (But) don't blink
So I been tryin' to slow it down
I been tryin' to take it in
In this here today, gone tomorrow world we're livin' in
Don't blink
Just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growin' like mine did
Turnin' into moms and dads
Next thing you know
Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're prayin' God takes you instead
Trust me friend
A hundred years goes faster than you think
(So) (But) don't blink
Naw, don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
Don't blink
Don't blink
Life goes faster than you think
I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think or let you see one thing for yourself
But now you're off with someone else and I'm alone
You see I thought I might keep you for my own

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Don't you think the time is right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper could be right in time
And can you see which way we should turn together or alone
I can never see what's right or what is wrong
Don't you take too long to tell me

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

Now it's come to what you want you've had your way
And all the things you thought before just faded into gray
And can you see that I don't know if it's you or if it's me
If it's one of us I'm sure we both will see
Won't you look at me and tell me

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I, longer if I do

Amie, what you wanna do
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do

She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night.

Chorus:
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her 'til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby.

The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind,
Until the night.

Chorus: (Both)
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby.

You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems Like every other week you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there

You say that its important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
Each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know its not too late 'cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New Englands through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
Ive been told its beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again theres just one thing you outta know
When the icy winds blow through you remember that its me
Who feels the cold most of all

When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know its not too late 'cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New Englands through with you
Well a man come on the 6 o'clock news
Said somebody's been shot, somebody's been abused
Somebody blew up a building
Somebody stole a car
Somebody got away
Somebody didn't get too far yeah
They didn't get too far

Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them hign in the street for all the people to see that

CHORUS:


Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
Send 'em all to their maker and he'll settle 'em down
You can bet he'll set 'em down 'cause

Chorus (x2)
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You know just what i was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone i really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when i looked to the moon it turned to gold

Blue moon
Now i'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
And when i looked the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now i'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
Now i'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
No time left now for shame
Horizon behind me, no more pain
Windswept stars blink and smile
Another song, another mile

You read the line every time
Ask me about crime in my mind
Ask me why another road song
Funny but I bet you never left home

Chorus:
On a good day, I know it aint every day
We can part the sea
And on a bad day, I know it aint every day
Glory beyond our reach

Fourteen seconds until sunrise
Tired but wiser for the time
Lightning 30 miles away
Three thousand more in two days

Chorus 2x
Do you remember
When we fell in love
We were young
And innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall
We'd be together
All day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands
In each other's eyes
We'd stare
(Tell me)

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk
(Ya know)
We'd stay on the phone
At night till dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said like
I love you so
I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met girl
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

When we fell in love
Do you remember the time
When we first met
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time

Remember the times
Ooh

Do you remember girl
Remember the times
On the phone you and me
Remember the times
Till dawn, two or three
What about us girl

Remember the times
Do you. do you, do you,
Do you, do you
Remember the times
In the park, on the beach
Remember the times
You and me in spain
Remember the times
What about, what about...

Remember the times
Ooh... in the park
Remember the times
After dark..., do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the times
Yeah yeah
Remember the times
Our paths may never cross again
Maybe my heart will never mend
But I'm glad for all the good times
'Cause you brought me so much sunshine
And love was the best it's ever been

I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed lovin' you girl
You've made my whole life worth while
With your smile
I wouldn't trade one memory
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world

They say that all good things must end
Love comes and goes just like the wind
You've got your dreams to follow
But if I had my chance tomorrow
You know I'd do it all again

I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed lovin' you girl
You've made my whole life worth while
With your smile
I wouldn't trade one memory
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world

Ooh...I wouldn't trade one memory
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world

I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed lovin' you girl
You've made my whole life worth while
With your smile
Ooh...I wouldn't trade one memory
I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wires I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you and I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you and I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I was walking home from school on a cold winter day
Took a shortcut through the woods, and I lost my way
It was getting late, and I was scared and alone
But then a kind old man took my hand and led me home
Mama couldn't see him, oh but he was standing there
And I knew in my heart, he was the answer to my prayers

Chorus:
Oh I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

When life held troubled times, and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone to come along and comfort me
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand
And ain't it kind of funny at the dark end of the road
That someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope

Chorus

They wear so many faces, show up in the strangest places
To grace us with their mercy, in our time of need

Chorus

To guide us with a light of love
I'd like to hold my head up and be proud of who I am,
but they won't let my secret go untold.
I paid the debt I owed them, but they're still not satisfied,
now I'm a branded man out in the cold,

When they let me out of prison, I held my head up high,
determined I would rise above the shame.
But no matter where I travel, the black mark follows me,
I'm branded with a number on my name.
If I live to be a hundred, guess I'll never clear my name,
'cause everybody knows I've been in jail.

No matter where I'm living,
I've got to tell them where I've been,
or they'll send me back to prison if I fail.

Now I'm a branded man out in the cold.
Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction,
Where I saw something I just had to have.
My mind told me I should proceed with caution,
but my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that.

And I said, "Hey pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine,
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call."
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine,
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind.
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold to the lady in the second row,
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know.
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!

Well, the auctioneer was goin' 'bout a mile a minute.
He was taking bids and callin' them out loud.
And I guess I was really gettin' in it,
'Cause I just shouted out above the crowd!

And I said, "Hey pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine,
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call."
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine,
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind.
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold to the lady in the long black dress,
Well she won my heart, it was no contest.
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!

Yeah, we found love on the auction block and I hauled her heart away.
Now we still love to laugh about, the way we met that day!

When I said "Hey pretty lady! Won't you gimme a sign?
I'd give anything to make you mine, all mine,
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call."
Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine,
Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind.
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold to the lady in the second row,
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know.
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

Don't know why
I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2.

Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

Can't be late
I leave plenty of time
Shaking hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock.

Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I hear a voice
That say's I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race
And there ain't no room
For someone in second place.

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why...
Has he lost his mind
Can he see or is he blind
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall

Is he alive or dead
Has he thoughts within his head
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!
I was feelin' the blues,
I was watching the news,
When this fella came on the TV.
He said, "I'm tellin' you
That science has proven
That heartaches are healed by the sea."
Well, that got me goin'
Without even knowin'
And I packed right up and drove down.
Now I'm on a roll
And I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town.

So, bring me two piña coladas.
I want one for each hand.
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan.
Oh, we never leave dry land.
Hey, troubles? I forgot 'em.
I buried 'em in the sand.
So, bring me two piña coladas.
She said good-bye to her good timin' man. (Good-bye!)

Oh, now I've gotta say
That the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind
By leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings.
Now, I've got a smile
That goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam.
And I've gotta say
That I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home.

So, bring me two piña coladas.
I gotta have one for each hand.
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan.
Oh, we never leave dry land.
Hey, troubles? I forgot 'em.
I buried 'em in the sand.
So, bring me two piña coladas.
She said good-bye to her good timin' man.

Bring me, bring me two piña coladas.
(Yeah!) I want one for each hand.
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan.
Oh, we never leave dry land.
(No troubles. I forgot 'em) Troubles? I forgot 'em.
(I buried 'em in the sand) I buried her in the sand. (Ha ha!)
So, bring me two piña coladas.
And say hello to her good timin' man.

Bring me two piña coladas.
I gotta have one for each hand.
Le's all set sail with Captain Morgan.
And we will never leave dry land. (Ha ha!)
Hey, troubles? I forgot 'em.
I’m going out tonight - I’m feeling alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise - really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

No inhibitions - make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain’t gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

The best thing about bein’ a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun

Oh, oh, oh go totally crazy - forget I’m a lady
Men’s shirts - short skirts
Oh, oh, oh really go wild - yeah, doin’ my style
Oh, oh, oh get in the action - feel the attraction
Color my hair - do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh I wanna be free - yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like I woman!

The girls need a break - tonight we’re gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don’t need romance - we only wanna dance
We’re gonna let our hair hang down

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun

Oh, oh, oh go totally crazy - forget I’m a lady
Men’s shirts - short skirts

I get totally crazy
Can you feel it
Come, come, come on baby
I feel like a woman
I've seen a lot of places
I've been around the world
I've seen pretty faces
Been with some beautiful girls
After all I've witnessed
One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle, you have to see to believe

Chorus:
(Cause) God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave 'em a place where they could dance
If you wanna see heaven, brother, here's you chance
I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas.

First, He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see
Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest, then on the very next day

(Chorus) (x2)

Well I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Well I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas.
I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's been 15 years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in teh mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive


I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

Sometimes it lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good

It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin'
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't everyday be just this good
You've been lookin' for love all around the world
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?
Why not me?
Well, you've finally come down to your old hometown
Your Kentucky girl's been waiting patiently
Why not me?

(Chorus)

Why not me on a rainy day?
Why not me to love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me when the nights get cold?
Why not me when you're growin' old?
Why not me?

You've been searchin' from here to Singapore
Ain't it time that you notice the girl next door, baby
Why not me?
You had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned how good settlin' down could be
Why not me?

(Repeat Chorus)

You've been lookin' for love all around the world
Baby, don't you know this country girl's still free?

(Repeat and Fade)

Baby, why not me?
Yeah, she's my lady luck
Hey, I'm her wild card man
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand
We live out in the country
Hey, she's my little queen of the south
Yeah, we're two of a kind
Workin' in a full house

She wakes me every mornin'
With a smile and a kiss
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist
She's my easy lovin' woman
I'm her hard workin' man, no doubt
Yea, we're two of a kind
Workin' on a full house

Yeah, a pickup truck is her limousine
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans
She loves me tender when the goin' get tough
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up

Lord I need that little woman
Like the crops need the rain
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane
We really fit together
If you know what I'm talkin' about
Yeah, we're two of a kind
Workin' on a full house

This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind
Lord the perfect combination is her heart and mine
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps

So draw the curtain, honey
Turn the lights down low
We'll find some country music on the radio
I'm yours and you're mine
Hey, that's what it's all about
Yeah we're two of a kind
Workin' on a full house

Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind
Workin' on a full house
CHORUS:
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I´m-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could di-ie
Bye bye my love goodby-eye

There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

CHORUS

I´m-a through with romance, I´m a-through with love
I´m through with a´countin´ the stars above

FADE: Bye bye my love goodby-eye
Bye bye my love goodby-eye
Any day now, I will hear you say,
Good bye, my love.
And you'll be on your way.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, I'll be all alone.

Any day now, when your restless eyes meets someone new,
Oh, to my sad surprise,
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down.

I know I shouldn't want to keep you,
If you don't want to stay,
Until you're gone forever,
I'll keep holding on for dear life.

Holding you this way,
Begging you to stay,
Any day now, when the clock strikes go, you'll call it off.
Then my tears will flow.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, love will let me down.
Cause you won't be around.

INSTRUMENTAL

Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town.
Any day now, love will let me down,
Cause you won't be around.
Any day now, you won't be around
� No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around.
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just the telephone
Papa called mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were all right
Mama would wait for that call to come in
But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Chorus

Momma was a looker
Lord how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa Loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen

Well, it was bound to happen
One night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin to surprise her he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
Then I heard the bottle break against the bedroom wall
That ol' Diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town.

Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes, and he was shifting gears.

Chorus
Well, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me.
Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
I'll be the reason that you tell the boys no.

Don't you know you can tell everyone that we're through
You might even believe it too
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the face that you see in the crowd
I'll be the times that you cry out loud
I'll be the smile when there's no one around
I'll be the book that you just can't put down
So you can walk out on me tonight.

If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me
You'll see sweet darling, there's ain't no getting over me
No, no, no, no, No Darling, there ain't no getting over me.

Ooooh mmmm
mmmm No darling, there ain't no getting over me.

Ooooh darling, there ain't no getting over me...
Lazy days calling to you
Come out and play, the future lies with you
Now you can be sure love is the cure
What we're searching for is to have a jolly good time
Crazy days but you'll get me through
And here I'll stay holding on to you
Now you can be sure our thoughts unpure
We'll unlock the door and we will have a jolly good time
It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason to sit around and wait
The world can change in a second
So I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate and dream
And dream
Lazy days, don't let them get you down
Wear your smile, I don't want to see you frown
Don't let them get you down
It can happen in any season
We don't need any reason to sit around and wait
The world can change in a second
So I find the sunshine beckons me
To open up the gate and dream
And dream
Then we will have a jolly good time
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah........
Whisper to me softly, breathe words upon my skin
No one's near and listening, so please don't say goodbye
Just hold me close and love me, press your lips to mine
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.

Lying here beside you I hear the echoes of your sighs
Promise me you'll stay with me and keep me warm tonight
So hold me close and love me, give my heart a smile
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.

--- Instrumental ---

Your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high
You're loving me so easy, you're wish is my command
Just hold me close and love me, tell me it won't end
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.

Feels so right.

Ah, you feel so right baby...
You're my always and forever
You're the one that hung the moon
After all these nights together
I still get lost in your perfume

And if I could write a love song
Every line would tell the truth
It would be a warm and soft one
And my heart would say to you

CHORUS:
When you see me walk on water
When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over
I won't need you anymore

Oh the feelings lay so easy
Lying here the way we are
No one else could ever hold me
Like the heavens hold the stars

CHORUS:
When you see me walk on water
When the sea don't reach the shore
When the fires of hell freeze over
I won't need you anymore
I won't need you anymore
I saw you starin' at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hidin' nothin' that I don't know.

There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.

--- Instrumental ---

You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long.

'Cause there's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.

There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer...
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
But you can be sure I know my part
'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I'll make mistakes
I'll never break your heart

I swear
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear
Like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the wall
And when there's silver in your hair
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as time turns the page
My love won't age at all

I swear
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear
Like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear

I swear
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear
Like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse
Till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear
I swear
Red Dirt Road Lyrics

I was raised off of old route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned the corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road.

Chorus:
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
And drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

Repeat Chorus

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
It feels like I found a long lost friend

Repeat Chorus
Well you thought I'd be waitin' up
When you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys
And you ended up half tight
But liquor and love
They just don't mix
Leave the bottle or me behind
And don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

No don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love
Well ya don't need none of mine
So don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind

(Instrumental)

You never take me anywhere
Because you're always gone
And many a night I've laid awake
And cried here all alone
Then you come in, a kissin' on me
It happens every time

No don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
No, don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love
Well, you don't need none of mine

So don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
No don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recongnize
When we see Old Glory flying there's alot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the Army when he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye
Man,we lit up your world like the 4th of July

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass it's the American way

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Ohhh
Of the red, white, and blue
Ohhh
I'm tired of this dirty old city.
Entirely too much work and never enough play.
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks.
Think I'll walk off my steady job today.

Turn me loose, set me free, somewhere in the middle of Montanna.
And gimme all I got comin' to me,
And keep your retirement and your so called social security.
Big City turn me loose and set me free.

Been working everyday since I was twenty.
Haven't got a thing to show for anything I've done.
There's folks who never work and they've got plenty.
Think it's time some guys like me had some fun.

Turn me loose, set me free, somewhere in the middle of Montanna.
And gimme all I got comin' to me,
And keep your retirement and your so called social security.
Big City turn me loose and set me free.

It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, cold towel, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
When I get where I'm going
On the far side of the sky
The first thing that I'm gonna do
Is spread my wings and fly
I'm gonna land beside a lion
And run my fingers through his mane
Or I might find out what it's like
To ride a drop of rain

Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

I'm gonna walk with my grandaddy
And he'll match me step for step
And I'll tell him how I missed him
Every minute since he left
Then I'll hug his neck

Yeah, when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
I will shed the sins and struggles
I have carried all these years
And I'll leave my heart wide open
I will love and have no fear
Yeah, when I get where I'm going
Don't cry for me down here

So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do
But when I get where I'm going
And I see my Maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of His amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going
Yeah, when I get where I'm going

She left without leaving a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up,
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If your calling 'bout the car, I sold it,
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling
If you got something to sell
Your wasting your time
I'm not buying
If it's anybody else
Wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you.

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kinda man would hang on that long
What kinda love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night,
I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back
When I get home
On Sunday afternoon,
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

This time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone
On Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

If you're calling 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I shoulda listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have
Taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
...I still love you
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

Chorus:
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's all right
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know
Or somebody she just met
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination
Or has her love turned into lies

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
Stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me,
The way you lovin’ me
The way you.. you did it to me!
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
Yeah, yeah..
Yeaaah! Yeaaah!
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
You rock my world, you rock my world!
You rock my world.. Come on girl

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

I read a note my grandma wrote back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat and he showed it once to me
He said," Boy you might not understand, but a long long time ago
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your grandma so
We had this crazy plan to meet, and run away together
Get married in the first towm we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter and this is what it said

*If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through, I don't know how long I'll be
But I'm not gonna let you down, Darling wait and see
And between now and then till I see you again
I'll be loving you..love, me

I read those words just hours before my grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church where me and grandpa stopped to pray
I know I never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her
His eyes filled up with tears
*
And between now and then till I see you again
I'll be loving you... love, me
(Introduction, only on live album „An Evening Wasted With Tom Lehrer“, spoken:)
''The outpatients are out in force tonight, I see, good! Now...
I'm sure you're all aware that this week is'' National Gall
Bladder Week, ''and so as sort of an educational feature at
this point I thought I would acquaint you with some of the
results of my recent researches into the career of the late
Doctor Samuel Gall, inventor of the gall bladder, which
certainly ranks as one of the more important technological
advances since the invention of the joy buzzer and the dribble
glass.
Dr. Gall's faith in his invention was so dramatically vindicated
last year, as you no doubt recall, when, for the first time
in history in a nationwide poll, the gall bladder was voted
among the top ten organs.
His educational career began, interestingly enough, in
agricultural school, where he majored in animal husbandry,
until they...caught him at it one day... whereupon he switched
to the field of medicine, in which field he also won renown as
the inventor of gargling, which prior to that time had been
practiced only furtively by a remote tribe in the Andes who
passed the secret down from father to son as part of their
oral tradition.
He soon became a specialist, specializing in diseases of the
rich. He was therefore able to retire at an early age...
To the land we all dream about: sunny Mexico, of course,
the last part of which is completely irrelevant, as was the
whole thing, I guess, except it's a rather sneaky way of
getting into this next type of popular song, which is one
of those things about that magic and romantic land south of
the border.''

When it's fiesta time in Guadalajara,
Then I long to be back once again
In Old Mexico.
Where we lived for today, never giving a thought to tomara.
To the strumming of guitars,
In a hundred grubby bars
I would whisper "Te amo."

The mariachis would serenade,
And they would not shut up till they were paid.
We ate, we drank, and we were merry,
And we got typhoid and dysentery.

But best of all, we went to the Plaza de Toros.
Now whenever I start feeling morose,
I revive by recalling that scene.
And names like Belmonte, Domingu'in, and Manolete,
If I live to a hundred and eighty,
I shall never forget what they mean.

(spoken) ''For there is surely nothing more beautiful in this
world than the sight of a lone man facing single-handedly
a half a ton of angry pot roast!''

Out came the matador,
Who must have been potted or
Slightly insane, but who looked rather bored.
Then the picadors of course,
Each one on his horse,
I shouted „Olé!“ ev'ry time one was gored.

I cheered at the banderilleros' display,
As they stuck the bull in their own clever way,
For I hadn't had so much fun since the day
My brother's dog Rover
Got run over.

(spoken) ''Rover was killed by a Pontiac. And it was done
with such grace and artistry that the witnesses awarded the
driver both ears and the tail – but I digress...''

The moment had come,
I swallowed my gum,
We knew there'd be blood on the sand pretty soon.
The crowd held its breath,
Hoping that death
Would brighten an otherwise dull afternoon.

At last, the matador did what we wanted him to,
He raised his sword and his aim was true.
In that moment of truth, I suddenly knew
That someone had stolen my wallet.

Now it's fiesta time in Akron, Ohio,
But it's back to old Guadalajara I'm longing to go.
Far away from the strikes of the A.F. of L. and C.I.O.
How I wish I could get back
To the land of the wetback,
And forget the Alamo,
In Old Mexico. Olé!
Count de LaFey uncovered his cheating wife.
Nine months of loving and sharing....
Oh, it was a bastard child!
How could he have been so blind?!
"No bastard baby will inherit what's mine!"
Another one of her affairs had left him in despair....
So he pushed her down the stairs to die. . .
"No!" she cried. . .
In 1777, on the 7th Day of July. . . .
The Countess broke her neck,
And the embryo came out dead.
Then he burned his beloved wife,
And the embryo he gave a name. . .
"Abigail, you must rest in shame!
Rest in shame!"
Obsessed
With a strange idea,
He wanted to mummify
The girl for the future to find . . . and he did.
So he pushed her down the stairs to die. . .
"No!" she cried. . .
In 1777, on the 7th Day of July. . . .
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher,
Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico.
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education,
And two of them were searchin' for lost souls.
That driver never ever saw the stop sign.
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime.

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows.
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go.

That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres,
The faith an' love for growin' things in his young son's heart.
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children:
Did her best to give 'em all a better start.
An' that preacher whispered: "Can't you see the Promised Land?"
As he laid his blood-stained bible in that hooker's hand.

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows.
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go.

That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday.
As he held that blood-stained bible up,
For all of us to see.
He said: "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' that preacher;
"Who gave this Bible to my mamma,
"Who read it to me."

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway,
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know.
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go.

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway.
Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees

Love is in the air

In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

CHORUS

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh oh oh

Love is in the air
In the rising of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe inr

And it's there when I look in your eyes

CHORUS (4x)
I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be.
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free.
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time.
I never thought that I would get caught.
It seemed like a perfect crime.

Baby, you left me defenseless,
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

I thought it would be so simple,
Like a thousand times before.
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away.
But I never made it to the door.
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy.
Go ahead and throw the book at me.
If lovin' you's a crime,
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree...
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world just keeps on turning

Let's just be glad, we had this time
To spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning.

Lay your head on my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body next to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Beating soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times.

I get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find
You ever need me.

Don't say a word
About tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough
For sadness when you leave.

Lay your head on my pillow â ¦
You know a dream is a like a river
Ever changing as it flows
And the dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores... and

Chorus:
I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Too many times we stand aside
Let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
It has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide... yes

Repeat Chorus

There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all...yes

Repeat Chorus

Yes I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
'Til the river runs dry
American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recongnize
When we see Old Glory flying there's alot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the Army when he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye
Man,we lit up your world like the 4th of July

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass it's the American way

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Ohhh
Of the red, white, and blue
Ohhh
I was getting kinda tired
Of her endless chatter
Nothing I could say
Ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive
Just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead
It looked like a place
To find some satisfaction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

I paid the man at the door
And pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink
Over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool
Tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen
To a word he said
I knew somewhere
Amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
If you please
A lot more loving
Is what I need
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

Well she was fighting them off
At a corner table
She had a longneck bottle
She was peeling the label
The look on her face
It was perfectly clear
She said somebody please
Get me out of here
The look she shot me
Through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
If you please
A lot more loving
Is what I need
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
A lot more action
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

Get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action
Chorus:
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till you get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler, roll on. (roll on.)

Well, it's Monday morning, he's kissin' momma goodbye
He's up and gone with the sun
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And he's off on a midwest run
As three sad faces gather round momma
They ask her when daddy's comin' home
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler
And they sure miss him when he's gone (yeah they do)
Ah, but he calls them everynight
And he tells them that he loves them
And he taught them this song to sing.

Chorus:
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till ya get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on. (roll on.)

Well, it's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone
It rings but it's not his voice
Seems the highway patrol has found a jackknifed rig
In a snow bank in Illinois
But the driver was missin'
And the search had been abandoned.
'Cause the weather had everything stalled
And they had checked all the houses and the local motels
When they had some more news they'd call
And she told them when they found him
To tell him that she loved him
And she hung up the phone singin'.

Chorus:
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till ya get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on.

Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long
Thinkin' nothing but the worst is comin'
With the ringin' of the telephone
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening
When momma asked him to bring daddy home
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end
Askin' her if she had been singin' the song, singin'.

Chorus:
Roll on highway, roll on along
Roll on daddy till ya get back home
Roll on family, roll on crew
Roll on momma like I asked you to do
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on (roll on)

Eighteen-wheeler

Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where i grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers out on his old porch swing

Says he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy
He said I'll see my wife and son in just a little while
I asked him what he meant
He looked at me and smiled, said

[Chorus]
I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
Oh i believe

Few years later i was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Getting all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said oh by the way son, old man Wrigley's died.

Later on that night, i laid there thinkin' back
Thought 'bout a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man who looked me in the eye, said

[Chorus]
I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see

I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that i live
Yeah, this can't be
No, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

[Chorus]
When I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red

Hey
Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey
If you happen to see the most beautiful girl
That walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey
Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did, was she crying, crying?
Hey
If you happen to see the most beautiful girl
That walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her

If you happen to see the most beautiful girl
That walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take you gotta give so live and let live and let go oh oh oh oh
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime.....

I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime.....
You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from being made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no

Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face

And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
and given the chance I'd lie again

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me, all night long.
So many lover's games I could play with you
and on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong

Chorus:

But on the other hand, There's a golden band
To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand


In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes I found myself
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else

Repeat Chorus
When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitar
You're listenin' to the sound of the American heart
And opry music on a Saturday night
Brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye

Chorus:
Sing a song about the Heartland
The only place I feel at home
Sing about the way a good man
Works until the daylight's gone
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night
Where they still know wrong from right
Sing a song about the Heartland
Sing a song about my life

Repeat chorus
All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And ol' George Jones I'm glad to see is finally gettin' straight
And Waylon's stayin' home and lovin' Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
[Mandolin - fiddle - steel]
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to do
And cornbread and ice tea's took the place of pills and ninety proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah and I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris he is a movie star and he's moved off to LA
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah me and my rowdy friends done right it on down
Momma told her baby, "Girl take it real slow."
Girl told her momma, "Hey, I really gotta go.
He's waitin' in the car."
Momma said, "Girl you won't get far."

Thus are the dreams of an average Jane
Ninety miles an hour down a Lover's Lane
On a tank of dreams
Oh, if she could've only seen
That Fate's got cards that it don't wanna show

(CHORUS):

'Cause that boy is just a Walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
She's gonna know it in a matter of time
That boy is just a Walkaway Joe

Now just a little while into Abilene
He pulls into a station and he robs it clean
She's waitin' in the car
Oh, Underneath the Texaco star

She only wanted love, didn't bargain for this
She can't help but love him for the way he is
She's only seventeen
And there ain't no reasoning
So she'll ride this ride as far as it can go

CHORUS (1x)

Somewhere in a roadside motel room
Alone in the silence she wakes up too soon
And reaches for his arm
But she'll just keep reaching on
For the cold, hard truth revealed what it had known

'Cause that boy is just a Walkaway Joe
Born to be a leaver
Tell you from the word go
Destined to deceive her
He's the wrong kind of paradise
But it was just another lesson in life
That boy was a Walkaway Joe

All he was was a Walkaway Joe.
Well I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No I can't swig that sweet Champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern, or in a honky tonk, or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid, and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip

Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey ya'll' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So, here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door

Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hhell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
I said hell yeah!

As he says, "Honey that's for you,
It's not much, but it's the best
That I can do."

Chorus-both
Golden rings (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Waiting there (waiting there) for someone to take you home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune

Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring, I thee wed."

Chorus- both
Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone

She says, "One thing's for certain,
I don't love you any more."
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door

It's getting late have you seen my mates
Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer

My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting

Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight

Saturday night's alright alright alright

Well they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out "She's with me!"

A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting

Get about as oiled as a diesel train

Almost heaven, West Virginia,
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
Life is old there, older than the trees;
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze.

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong;
West Virginia, Mountain Mama.
Take me home, country roads.

All my memories gather 'round her.
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye.

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong;
West Virginia, Mountain Mama.
Take me home, country roads.

I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me.
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong;
West Virginia, Mountain Mama.
Take me home, country roads.

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong;
West Virginia, Mountain Mama.
Take me home, country roads.
Take me home, (down) country roads.
Take me home, (down) country roads.
We said goodbye in Marina Del Ray
I had a good time
Was the last thing I heard her say
As I walked away
And on the plane back to Tennessee
My mind comes across her memory
And yesterday in Marina Del Ray

Chorus
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina Del Ray
And as we looked into each others eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina Del Ray

Like the ocean tides, highs and lows
Love sometimes comes and goes away
In Marina Del Ray
And as this plane is touching down
Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed
In Marina Del Ray

Chorus
On a hidden beach under a golden sun
She spread a blanket that we layed down on
And loved the world away
In Marina Del Ray
And as we looked into each others eyes
We found our bodies lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina Del Ray

We said goodbye in Marina Del Ray
I was born across the river
In the mountains where I call home.
Lord, times were good there.
Don't know why I ever roamed.

Oh, Tennessee River and a mountain man,
We get together anytime we can.

Me and my woman's done made our plans
On the Tennessee River, walkin' hand in hand
Gonna raise a famly, Lord, settle down

Forty Hour Week (For A Livin')


There are people in this country who work hard every day.
Not for fame or fortune do they strive.
But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay.
And it's time a few of them were recognized.

Hello Detroit auto workers, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.

This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail.
Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale.
Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail.
For everyone who works behind the scenes.

You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields.
In the city streets and the quiet country towns.
Working together like spokes inside a wheel.
They keep this country turning around.

Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.
Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time.
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line.

This one is for the one who drives the big rig, up and down the road.
Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load.
Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol.
For everyone who works behind the scenes.
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine.

Hello, America,
Let me thank you for your time.
Well, the midnight headlight
Find you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead
Slow me down makin' no time
I gotta keep rollin'
Those windshield wipers
Slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm
With the song on the radio
Gotta keep rollin'

Oooooooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Oooooooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Well the truck stop cutie
Comin' on to me
Tried to talk me into a ride
Said I wouldnt be sorry
But she was just a baby
Ah, waitress pour me another cup of coffee
Pop me down jack me up
Shoot me out flyin' down the highway
Lookin' for the morning

Oooooooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Oooooooh, I'm driving my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina;
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden;
I was in love but in vain, I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in,
Wild as the West Texas wind.
Dashing and daring,
A drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina,
The girl that I loved.

So in anger I

Challenged his right for the love of this maiden.
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat;
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the FOUL EVIL deed I had done.
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran,
Out where the horses were tied.
I caught a good one.
It looked like it could run.
Up on its back
And away I did ride,

Just as fast as I

Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico.

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless.
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left.
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death.

I saddled up and away I did go,
Riding alone in the dark.
Maybe tomorrow
A bullet may find me.
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart.

And at last here I

Am on the hill overlooking El Paso;
I can see Rosa's cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward.
Down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys;
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me.
I have to make it to Rosa's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side.
Though I am trying
To stay in the saddle,
I'm getting weary,
Unable to ride.

But my love for

Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen,
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle.
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

From out of nowhere Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina, good-bye.
Galveston, oh Galveston, I still hear your sea winds blowin'
I still see her dark eyes glowin'
She was 21 when I left Galveston

Galveston, oh Galveston, I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run

Galveston, oh Galveston, I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun
At Galveston, at Galveston
They say in this town
the stars stay up all night
Well I don't know can't see em'
For the glow of the neon lights
And it's a long way from here
To the place where the home fires burn
Well it's two thousand miles and one left turn

Chorus:
Dear Mom and Dad please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well I Don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry cause I'm alright
See I'm playin here at the bar tonight
Well this time I'm going make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love your baby girl

Black jack, blue sky,
Big town full of little white lies
Everybody's your friend
You can never be sure
They promise fancy cars and diamond rings
All sorts of shiny things
Girl you'll remember what your knees are for

Chorus:
Dear Mom and Dad please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
Well I don't need much just enough to get me through
Please don't worry cause i'm alright
See I'm playin here at the bar tonight
This time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well I love you more than anything in the world
Love your Baby Girl

Bridge:
I know that I'm on my way
Well I can tell everytime I play
And I know it's worth all the dues I pay
When I can write to you and say

Chorus 2:
Dear Mom and Dad I'll send money
I'm so rich that it ain't funny
Well it ought to be more than enough to get you through
Please don't worry cause I'm alright
See I'm stayin here at the Ritz tonight
Whatta ya know it made our dreams come true
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But I know that they don't mean anything
Well they don't add up to nothin compared to you
Remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world
Love your Baby Girl

Your Baby Girl
Your Baby Girl
He had plastic bags wrapped round his shoes.
He was covered with the evening news.
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands.

The bank sign was flashing five below,
It was freezing rain an' spittin' snow.
He was curled up behind some garbage cans.
I was afraid that he was dead.
I gave him a gentle shake.
When he opened up his eyes
I said, "Old man are you ok?"

He said, "I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree,
I was runin' from some honey bees.
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze,
After jumpin' into Calico creek.
I was walkin' down an old dirt road,
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed.
Man I wish you'd just left me alone,
'Cause I was almost home."

Then he said, "I's just comin' 'round the barn
Bout the time you grabbed my arm,
When I heard Momma holler 'son hurry up.'
I was close enough for my own nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate
Bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55
That's as close as I've been."

"Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree.
I was runin' from some honey bees.
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze,
After jumpin' into Calico creek.
I was walkin' down an old dirt road,
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed.
Man I wish you'd just left me alone,
I was almost home."

I said, "Old man you're gonna freeze to death.
Let me drive you to the mission."
He said, "Boy if you'd left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'"

"I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree.
I was runin' from some honey bees.
Drip dryin' in the summer breeze,
After jumpin' into Calico creek.
I was walkin' down an old dirt road,
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed.
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home."

(Almost Home)

"Man I wish you'd just left me alone, I was almost home."
Yeah, they call me the Fireman,
That's my name.
Makin' my rounds all over town
Puttin' out old flames.
Well everybody'd like to have what I got,
I can cool 'em down when their smolderin' hot.
I'm the Fireman,
That's my name.

Last night we had a bad one a mile or two down the road,
Yeah my buddy walked out and left his woman burnin' outta control.
Well I was down their in 'bout an hour or so,
With a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go.
I'm the Fireman,
That's my name.

(Repeat Chorus)

I got a fire engine red, T-Bird automobile,
In a minute or less I can be dress fit to kill.
I work twenty four on and twenty four off,
If they get too hot they just give me a call.
I'm the Fireman,
That's my name.

(Repeat Chorus)
You are far, when I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough
To even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind
Till you listen to your heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them
Steal your heart from you
People,Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So good-bye, but please don't take my heart

You are far, I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will, If you let them, steal your heart

And people, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you,
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through

But remember this, every other kiss,
That you ever give, long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you, like I always do
There's something there, that can't compare
With any other

You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people
Who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough
To think you'd love me too.
I guess you were kissing a fool

You must have been kissing a fool
(Darrell Brown/Radney Foster)

It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us 'til we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

I Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
'Cause we've got better things that we can do
When it's raining on Sunday

Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender is much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls

And pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon
And baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
'Cause we've got better things that we can do
When it's raining on Sunday
Ooh, oh oh

I Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
And baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
'Cause we've got better things that we can do
When it's raining on Sunday
Ooh, oh oh
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain
Whoo, ooh
Well I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night
I love to hear the thunder
Watch the lightning
When it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good

Well I love a rainy night
It's such a beautiful sight
I love to feel the rain
On my face
To taste the rain on my lips
In the moonlight shadow

CHORUS:
Showers washed
All my cares away
I'd wake up to a sunny day
'Cause I love a rainy night
Yes I love a rainy night
Well I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night

Well I love a rainy night
I love a rainy night
I love to hear the thunder
Watch the lightning
When it lights up the sky
You know it makes me feel good

Well I love a rainy night
It's such a beautiful sight
I love to feel the rain
On my face
To taste the rain on my lips
In the moonlight shadow

Puts a song
In this heart of mine
Puts a smile on my face every time

'Cause I love a rainy night
Yeah I love a rainy night
Ooh I love a rainy night
Yeah I love a rainy night

CHORUS
I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

Well I thought the day I met you you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
Now the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

Well every night you drag me where the bright lights're found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well I'm a losing weight and I'm turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Whose bed have your boots been under?

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
Whose bed have your boots been under?

Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

I heard you've been sneakin'
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walkin'
With long legs Louise
And you weren't just talkin'
Last night with Denise

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

Come on boots...

So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free

Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal I wonder?
This time did it feel like thunder, baby?
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under?

I wanna know whose bed, baby
Whoa baby, tell me
Whose bed, yes I wanna know
You better start talkin'
Or you better start walkin'...
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
Looking at you through a misty moonlight,
katydid sing like a symphony.
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby,
melody blowing through the willow tree.

What was I s'posed to do,
standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home...

(chorus)
Maybe it was Memphis,
maybe it was southern summer nights.
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me,
but it sure felt right.

Read about you in a Faulkner novel,
met you once in a Williams' play.
Heard about you in a country love song,
summer night beauty took my breath away.

What was I s'posed to do,
standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home.

(repeat chorus twice)

Every night now since I been back home,
I lie awake drifting in my memory.
Think about you on your mama's front porch swing
talking that way, so soft to me.

What was I s'posed to do,
standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home

(repeat chorus 'til fade)
Looks like we made it
Look how far we’ve come my baby

I’m so glad we made it
Look how far we’ve come my baby
Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin' Oooh
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger (stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Yeah now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now you say you've found someone that you love better (better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow ('morrow)
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Alright now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
(That it won't be long before it's cryin' time)
There's a little girl in our neighborhood,
her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good.
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone.
I walked over to her house and this was going on:

Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie,
her Mama was in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry.
Her daddy was in the backyard rollin' up a garden hose,
I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes...
and we were Swingin', yes we were Swingin'...
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sing,
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in this swing,
just-a-swingin,

Yeah, and we'll be swingin, yes, we'll be swinging.
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sang,
I can't believe I'm out here on the front porch in the swang,
just-a-swangin.

Now Charlotte she's the darlin', she's the apple of my eye,
and when I'm on the swang with her it makes me almost high.
And Charlotte is my lover and she has been since the sprang,
I just can't believe it started on her front porch in this swang.

Just a swangin, well just a swangin,
Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sang,
I can't believe I'm out here on the front porch in the swang,
just-a-swangin.

I said, Little Charlotte she's as pretty as the angels when they sang,
I can't believe I'm out here on her front porch in the swang,
just-a-swangin.
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for

And then suddenly appeared before me, the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold - oh oh oh

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills

Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop
I still dream about that

Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top
Looking for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee

--- Instrumental ---

I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped like a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a pity life
Can't be simple again

Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ole Rocky Top, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee

Operator, please connect me
With 1982
I need to make apologies
For what I didn't do
I sure do need to tell her
That I've thought the whole thing through
And now it's clear that she is what
I should have held on to

They say hindsight's 20/20
But I'm nearly going blind
From staring at her photograph
And wishing she was mine
It's that same old lost love story
It's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine
In 1982

Postman, can you sell me
A special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from
This crazy, lonely man
Back into the wasted years
Of my living past
I need to tell her now I know
How long my love will last

They say hindsight's 20/20
But I'm nearly going blind
From staring at her photograph
And wishing she was mine
It's that same old lost love story
It's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine
In 1982
Losing my mind going back in time
To 1982

Superstar djs
Here we go
That summer:

I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
she was a lonely widowed woman
hell-bent to make it on her own
we were a thousand miles from no where
wheat fields as far as I could see
both needing something from each other
not knowing yet what that might be
till she came to me one evening
hot cup of coffee and a smile
in a dress that I was certain
she hadn't worn in quite a while
there was a difference in her laughter
there was a softness in her eye
and on the air there was a hunger
even a boy could recognize

chorus:
she had a need to feel the thunder
to chase the lightning from the sky
to watch the storm with all its wonder
raging in her lover's eye
she had to ride the heat of passion
like a comet burning bright
rushing head long in the wind
now where only dreams had been
burning both ends of the night

that summer wind was all around me
nothing between us but the night
when I had told her that I never
she softly whispered thats all right
and then I watched her hands of leather
turn to velvet in a touch
there's never been another summer
when I have ever learned so much

chorus:
we had a need to feel the thunder
to chase the lighning from the sky
to watch the storm with all its wonder
raging in each other's eye
we had to ride the heat of passion
like a comet burning bright
rushing head long in the wind
now where only dreams had been
burning both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
the sweat the moonlight and the lace
I have rarely held another
when I haven't seen her face
every time I pass a wheat field
watch it dancing with the wind
although I know it isn't real
I just can't help but feel
her hungry arms again

chorus ~ (she)

rushing head long in the wind
now where only dreams had been
burning both ends of the night
You had not've fallen then I would not've found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around awhile
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away for love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
[ guitar ]
Fly on fly on past the speed of sound I'd rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
So leave me if you need to I will still remember angel flying too close to the ground
Living on free food tickets,
water in the milk from a hole in the roof
where the rain came through.
What can you do?
Tears from your little sister,
crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
for the party to go.
But you she'll get by

'cause she's living in the love of the common people,
smile's from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
and she can.

It's a good thing you don't have a busfare,
it would fall thru' the hole in your pocket and you'd lose it
in the snow on the ground.
You got to walk into town to find a job.
Tryin' to keep your hands warm
when the hole in your shoe lets the snow come thru'
and chills you to the bone.
Now you'd better go home where it's warm,

where you can live in a love of the common people,
smile from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
and she can.

Living on a dream ain't easy
but the closer the knit the tighter the fit
and the chills stay away.
You take 'em in stride for family pride.
You know that faith is in your foundation
and with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
but don't forget to pray.
Making it strong were you belong

and we're living in the love of the common people,
smile's from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
and she can.

Yes, we're living in the love of the common people,
smile's from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can.

Yes, we're living in the love of the common people,
smile's from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can.

Yes, we're living in the love of the common people,
smile's really hard on a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can
and she can.

I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say I was taking it hard
Oh, she wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

Chorus:
Well, the race is on and here comes pride
Up the backstretch
Heartaches are a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
And tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

Instrumental

One day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each mornin'
And thinking that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
I came out in second place

Chorus:
Well, the race is on and here comes pride
Up the backstretch
Heartaches are a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
And tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

The winner loses all...
Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me - darling rescue me
With your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me - darling rescue me
When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free - darling rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needing you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please- darlin rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see- darling rescue me
Clear creeks
Cool mountian mornins'
Honest work out in the field
Corn bread, In my mommas kitchen
Daddy sayin grace before the meal
Family ties run deep in this land
And im never very far from what i am

(chorus) i was born country
And thats what ill always be
like the rivers and the woodlands wild an free
i got a hundred years of down home runnin through my blood
i was born country
and this country is what i love

Moonlight and you here beside me
crickets seranadin in the yard
What more could two people ask for
layin here in love beneath the stars
now this is where i wanna raise my kids
just the way my mom and daddy did

(chorus)
I was born country.......fade out to end
Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy [Whoa, whoa]
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Money's tight, he's workin' every night
It ain't easy to keep the flame alive
And when he finally comes home to ya
He's just too tired to do the things you want to

You can't help but wonder to yourself
How would it be with someone else
Just keep in mind, every storm ends in time
Love is forever, stay together

[Stay together] When you got something real
[Love forever] That you may never feel again

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy [Whoa, whoa]
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Now you're the man, you've got to understand
She don't mean to make a scene
Like you, she feels all the weight you're under
And when she breaks, is it any wonder

I know sometimes it crosses your mind
To get on out and stay hard to find
Before you try, you'd better look in her eyes
Love is forever, stay together

[Stay together] You've got something real
[Love forever] That you may never feel again
[You've got a lot]

[Stay together]
[Love forever]
You've got something real
That you may never feel again

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy [Oh, oh]
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Don't give up your good thing
Don't give it, oh, don't, oh, oh
Don't give up your good thing
Please don't, oh, don't
Don't live it up, don't give it up

Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy [Oh, oh]
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Never give up on a good thing [Oh, he's all you need]
Remember what makes you happy [Whoa, whoa]
Never give up on a good thing
If love is what you got, you've got a lot

Never give up on a good thing [Oh, he's all you need]
Remember what makes you happy [Whoa, oh]
Never give up on a good thing
Now here I am again in this mean old town,
And you're so far away from me.
Now where are you when the sun goes down,
You're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Alright.

I'm tired of being in love and being all alone,
When you're so far away from me.
I'm tired of making out on the telephone,
Cause you're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Alright.

And I get so tired when I have to explain,
That you're so far away from me.
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain,
And you're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Check it out.

So far away.
You're so far away from me.
(You're so far.)
Alright.
(You're so far.)
Yes, you're so far away from me.
Everybody wants a little piece of my time
But still I put you at the end of the line
How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
To see the tears you cry fallin' like rain

Give me the chance to prove
And I'll make it up to you

I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standing so strong and true
Baby I still believe in you and me

Somewhere along the way, I guess I just lost track
Only thinkin' of myself never lookin' back
For all the times I've hurt you, I apologize
I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize

Give me the chance to prove
That nothing's worth losing you

I still believe in you
With a love that will always be
Standing so strong and true
Baby I still believe in you and me
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man
You'll have sad times and he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him be proud of him cause after all he's just a man
Stand by your man give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to when the nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can stand by your man
Stand by your man and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can stand by your man
He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away
On the road and hanging by a song
But the strings already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long.

It's Colorado Rocky Mountain High
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby
Rocky Mountain High (In Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)

He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept his memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight is turned inside of himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain High
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of the simple things he can not comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

In the Colorado Rocky Mountain High
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly
Rocky mountain high
The Colorado Rocky Mountain High
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain High (High in Colorado)
I think I'll take a moment to celebrate my age
The ending of an era, and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord, have mercy on my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
I'm gonna have some fun
Trying to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here, in my next thirty years

Oh my next thirty years
I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers, huh
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years
Will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here
In my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
oh yha

CHORUS
I can see it in your eyes,
And feel it your touch.
I know that you’re scared,
But you’ve never been this loved.

It’s a long shot baby,
Yeah I know it’s true.
But if anyone can make it,
I’m betting on me and you.

Just keep on moving into me.
I know you’re gonna see,
The best is yet to come.

CHORUS:
Don’t fear it now we’re going all the way.
That sun is shining on a brand new day.
It’s a long way down and it’s a leap of faith,
But I’m never giving up,
‘Cause I know we got a once in a lifetime love.

Everybody’s looking for what we found.
Some wait their whole life,
And it never comes around

So don’t hold back now just let go,
On all you’ve ever known.
You can put you’re hand in mine.

CHORUS

I close my eyes and I see you standing right there.
Saying “I do” and they’re throwing the rice in our hair.
Well the first one’s born and a brother comes along and he’s got your smile.
I been looking back on the life we had still by your side.

CHORUS
Composed by Townes VanZandt

Living on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only son
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams

Poncho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Poncho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dyin' words
But that's the way goes

All the Federales say,
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away,
Out of kindness, I suppose

Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Poncho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
Day they laid poor Poncho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows

All the Federales say,
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away,
Out of kindness, I suppose

[ guitar ]

The poets tell how Poncho fell
And Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Poncho needs your prayers, it's true
Vut save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old

All the Federales say,
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away,
Out of kindness, I suppose

A few grey Federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so long,
Out of kindness, I suppose.
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman giving all your love to just one man
You'll have sad times and he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him be proud of him cause after all he's just a man
Stand by your man give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to when the nights are cold and lonely
Stand by your man and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can stand by your man
Stand by your man and show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can stand by your man
Six lanes, tail lights
Red ants marching into the night
Disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A 99-cent heart attack
I've got a pounding head and an achin back
And the camels buried in the big straw stack

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the West
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
Caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is getting dark
There's concrete growin in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
There's bars on the corners and bars on my heart

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Oh, where the green grass grows
There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.

An' I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do, mmm, mmm
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you
When you put your arms around me,
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do.

I used to run in circles goin' no-where fast.
I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back.
I Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mmm, mmm.
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.

Whoa here we go now!
--- Instrumental with ad libs ---

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,
Shinin' down on me and you.
When you put your arms around me,
Well, baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do.

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand,
When you're teachin' me to be a better man.
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no.
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.

I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you. Oooh.

And I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you, yeah.

Hey, I wanna love you baby.

--- Instrumental ---

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, I wanna be the man in the middle of the night,
Shinin' like it's true.
I wanna be the man that you run to whenever I call on you
When everything that loved someone finally found it's way
Wanna be a better man
I see it in you yeah...

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the street
Got a beautiful sound
It's got a beautiful beat

It's a beautiful noise
Goin' on everywhere
Like the clickety-clack
Of a train on a track
It's got a rhythm to spare

It's a beautiful noise
And it's sound that I love
And it's fit me as well
As a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up from the park
It's the song of the kids
And it plays until dark

It's the song of the cars
On their furious flights
But there's even romance
In the way that they dance
To beat of the lights

It's a beautiful noise
And it's a sound that I love
And it makes me feel good
Like a hand in a glove
Yes it does, yes it does
What a beautiful noise

It's a beautiful noise
Made of joy an of strife
Like a symphony played
By a passing parade
It's the music of life

What a beautiful noise
Comin' up to my room
And it's beggin' for me
Just to give it a tune
Instrumental
I've been up to my neck
working six days a week
wearing holes in the soles
of the shoes on my feet
been dreamin of getting away
since I dont know
ain't no better time than now...
for Mexicoooo

No shoes no shirt no problem
blues what blues....hey I forgot em'
the sun and the sand
and a drink in my hand
with no bottom
and no shoes, no shirt, no problems

no problems

want a towel or a chair
in the sand by the sea
wanna look through my shades
and see you there with me
wanna soak up life for awhile
and lay back low
no boss no clock no stress
no dress code

No shoes no shirt no problem
blues, what blues?
hey I forgot em
the sun and the sand
and a drink in my hand
with no bottom
no shoes, no shirt, no problems

babe lets get packed
tank tops and flip flops
if you got em
no shoes no shirts no problems
no problems
You've got a thing or two
To learn about me baby
Cause I ain't taking it no more
And I don't mean maybe
You don't know right from wrong
Well the love we had is gone

So blame it on your
Lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin
Two timing, double dealing
Mean, mistreatin
Lovin heart

Well all I wanted was to be
Your one and only
And all I ever got from you
Was bein lonely
Now that dream is laid to rest
Cause you have failed the test

So blame it on your
Lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin
Two timing, double dealing
Mean, mistreatin
Lovin heart

Are you heading for a heartache
Oh yeah
Gonna get a bad break

Another love like mine

Someone's gonna do you
Like you've done me honey
And when she does you

It ain't funny
You'll need some sympathy
But don't be calling me

Hey blame it on your

Yeah blame it on your
Lying, cheating
Cold, dead beatin
Two timing, double dealing
Mean, mistreatin
Lovin heart
We call them cool
Those hearts who have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flames
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exsist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell-bent on giving
Walking a wire
Convinced it's not living
If you stand outside the fire

(Chorus)
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

There's this love that is burning
Deep in my soul constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to glide higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

(Repeat Chorus Twice)
We've been up all night long
Trying to solve a problem, well, it's almost dawn
Ain't no time for sleeping if our love is wearing thin
'Cause I ain't giving up, you ain't giving in.

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.

And real love walks, a real thin line
No communication will kill it every time
So open up your heart, baby we can work it out
'Cause we got the kind of love people dream about.

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.

It's past the point of right or wrong
Let's find a way to just hold on, yeah

--- Instrumental ---

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away...
I'm a honky tonk night time man I can't stand no light
I'm a honky tonk night time man I can't stand no light
I get my rest in the daytime I make my running round at night

I had the blues this morning I had the blues all day today
I had the blues this morning I had the blues all day today
But when the sun goes down I'm gonna tuck my blues away away
[ guitar ]
Lord my heart starts beatin' when the sun starts sinking low
Lord my heart starts beatin' when the sun starts sinking low
When the shadows fall I know it's time to go
[ steel ]
I'm a honky tonk night time man...

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go thru
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me, it's plain
I should know I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night thru
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

I'm her hard workin' man, no doubt
Yea, we're two of a kind
Workin' on a full house

Yeah, a pickup truck is her limousine
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans
She loves me tender when the goin' get tough
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up

She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane
We really fit together

So draw the curtain, honey
Turn the lights down low

Workin' on a full house

Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind
Workin' on a full house

About the way we have to live here in this country,
Harpin' on the wars we fight,
An' gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be.
An' I don't mind 'em switchin' sides,
An' standin' up for things they believe in.
When they're runnin' down my country, man,
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me.

Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me.
Runnin' down the way of life,
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep.
If you don't love it, leave it:
Let this song I'm singin' be a warnin'.
If you're runnin' down my country, man,
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me.

I read about some squirrely guy,
Who claims, he just don't believe in fightin'.
An' I wonder just how long,
The rest of us can count on bein' free.
They love our milk an' honey,
But they preach about some other way of livin'.
When they're runnin' down my country, hoss,
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me.

Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me.
Runnin' down the way of life,
Our fightin' men have fought and died to keep.
If you don't love it, leave it:

(Never crossed her mind)
She don't know she's beautiful

A girl like her, she just can't see,
What the fuss is all about.

Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should have held you but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone, oh
Sleeping single in a double bed
Tossing, turning trying to forget
I could be lying with you, instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed

I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry
'Cause drinking doubles alone, don't make it a party
Another sleepless night, and it's the same old story
When you're the only one, at two in the morning

(Repeat chorus to fade)
I watch the snowflake fall
agenst my window plain
and wonder if you
are watchin snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
Theres joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is

[Chorus]
Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonley just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle bear(?)
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is

[Chorus]


This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me)

[Chorus]
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wond'ring in the night
What were the chances we'd be sharing love
Before the night was through.

Something in your eyes was so inviting,
Something in you smile was so exciting,
Something in my heart,
Told me I must have you.

Strangers in the night, two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello.
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away,
A warm embracing dance away and......

Ever since that night we've been together.
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.
It turned out so right,
For strangers in the night.

La da da da da.......
Out of a million seeds
Only the strongest one breathes
You made a miracle mother
I'll make a man out of me

Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky?
What did we do wrong, why did it die?
And all the grown ups say 'sorry kids we got no reply'

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I've got more than I need
When your love shines down on me

Every tear that you cry
Will be replaced when you die
Why don't you love your brother?
Are you out of your mind?

Daddy where's the sun gone from the sky?
What did we do wrong, why did it die?
And if you've got no love for me then I'll say goodbye

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I've got more than I need
When your love shines down on me

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I can't contain how I feel
When your love shines down on me

Well if you want it come and make a stance
So when it's in your hands
People show me love
Well if you want it come and make a stance
So when it's in your hands
People show me love

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I got more than I need
When your love shines down on me

If you're willing to change the world
Let love be your energy
I can't contain how I feel
When your love shines down on me
Folks said that you found someone new
To do the thing I used to do for you
Just call my name, I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Can't sleep at night, I can't eat a bite
When you were mine I didn't treat your right
Just call my name, I know, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you

Just like a king, I've lost everything
I sit all alone on my throne
I've got my pride but deep down inside
I'm yours, I'm yours alone

I try to forget, had no regrets
This love of ours could always start anew
Just call my name, wooh, I know I'm not ashamed
I'll come running back to you
I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holdin the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside, it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake?

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires.

Chorus:
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.

--- Instrumental ---

Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear.

I tell you what we need to do
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires.

Chorus:
'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line
I've got the perfect place in mind.
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires.

And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires...
He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.

I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.

(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.

(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...

(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd verse, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th verse ''I went to see my
friend today may be found saying ''I went to see him just today'')
I've held it all inward, God knows, I've tried,
But it's an awful awakening in a country boy's life,
To look in the mirror in total surprise.
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes.

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.

It's a measure of people who don't understand,
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band.
I got my first guitar when I was fourteen,
Well I finally made forty, still wearing jeans.

Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Amanda, light of my life.
Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife.
Bop

Put on your bobby sox, baby Roll up your old blue jeans.
There's a band playing down at the armory
That knows what rock-n-roll really means.
I want to ride in your fifty- five T-bird
Drive through some old memories
I ain't after your body, baby,
I just want you to dance with me.

Chorus:
I want to BOP with you baby, all night long
I wanna BOP the night away
I wanna make it a night like it used to be
When our hearts were young and our souls were free

I want to BOP with you baby, all night long
I wanna bebop with ya baby 'til the break of dawn
I want to BOP with you baby, all night long

I got an old photograph in my pocket
We were still in our teens
Lord knows I feel a lot older now,
But you still look the same to me.
Honey you don't ever laugh like you used to
And I don't want to see you blue
If you ain't busy tonight and you think it's all right
This is what I want to do.

(Chorus)

Let's twist and shout,
Just like in the good old days
Baby, watch out, you know I just can't stand it
When you look at me that way
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through those tight fittin' jeans

I asked her, "What's a woman like you, doin' here?
"I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer."
She said: "You've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem,
And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fittin' jeans."

She said: "I married money. I'm used to wearin' pearls.
"But I've always dreamed of bein' just a good ol' boy's girl.
"So tonight I left those crystal candle-lights to live a dream.
"And pardner, there's a tiger in these tight fittin' jeans."

We danced ev'ry dance and, Lord, the beer that we went through.
I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true.
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed.
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fittin' jeans.

In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say.
I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways.
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen,
That night I knew a lady wearin' tight fittin' jeans.

Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine,
But I know I'll always remember the time,
A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream,
And Lord, I loved that lady wearin' tight fittin' jeans.
You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling alright
So who does your past belong to today
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way

Girls in the bars thinkin' who is this guy
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shootin' that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

Tell me you're tryin' to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room
The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon

Everybody's talkin' but you don't hear a thing
Still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty why don't you come around
Baby what's so great about sleeping downtown

There's plenty of dives to be someone you're not
Just say you're looking for something you might have forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're tryin' to get home

Just tell 'em your tryin' to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room
The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon

Tell me you're tryin' to cure a seven year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say when is he gonna give us some room
The girls say, God, I hope he comes back soon
Judy in disguise, well that's what you are
Lemonade pies with a brand new car
Cantalope eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Keep a-wearing your bracelets and your new rah-rahs
Cross your hear-yah-with your livin' bra
Chimney sweep sparrow with guise
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Come to me tonight, come to me tonight
Taking everything in sight
Except for the strings on my kite

Judy in disguise, hey that's what you are
Lemonade pie, hey got your brand new car
Cantalope eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Come to me tonight, come to me tonight
Taking everything in sight, except for the strings to my kite

(Oh, Uh oh, Uhhh)
Judy in disguise, what you aiming for
A circus of a-horrors, yea yea, well that's what you are
You made me a life of ashes
I guess I'll just take your glasses
She Believes In Me


(Steve Gibb)

While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the night can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me!
Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees

Love is in the air

In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

CHORUS

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh oh oh

Love is in the air
In the rising of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe inr

And it's there when I look in your eyes

CHORUS (4x)
I rushed home from work like I always do.
I spent my whole day just thinking of you.
When I walked through the front door, my whole life was changed
Cause nobody answered when I called your name.

A note on the table that told me goodbye
Said you'd grown weary of living a lie.
Oh, your love has ended, but mine still remains;
But nobody answers when I call your name.

Oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane.
And just like rain, the tears keep falling;
But nobody answers when I call your name.

Oh, the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane.
And just like rain, the tears keep falling;
But nobody answers when I call your name.
Oh, nobody answers when I call your name.
I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

All my friends call me Bear claw
Village chieftain is my paw paw
He gets his orders from my maw maw
She makes him walk the line

You can find me in my Wigwam

Pull out the pipe and smoke ya some
Hey, and pass it around

I aint lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble, lord
Like a glass a wine

I remember the medicine man
He caught the runnin' water in my hands
Drug me around by my head band
Said I wasn't her kind

Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

I can kill a Deer or Buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards don't ya know
I do it all the time

They all gather round my teepee
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin but my Buffalo briefs
I got 'em standin' in line

Cause i'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

So proud to live
So proud to die
I remember Daddy's hands, folded silently in prayer.
And reaching out to hold me, when I had a nightmare.
You could read quite a story, in the callouses and lines.
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind.
I remember Daddy's hands, how they held my Mama tight,
And patted my back, for something done right.
There are things that I've forgotten, that I loved about the man,
But I'll always remember the love in Daddy's hands.

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'.
Daddy's hands, were hard as steel when I'd done wrong.
Daddy's hands, weren't always gentle
But I've come to understand.
There was always love in Daddy's hands.

I remember Daddy's hands, working til' they bled.
Sacrificed unselfishly, just to keep us all fed.
If I could do things over, I'd live my life again.
And never take for granted the love in Daddy´s hands.

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'.
Daddy's hands, were hard as steel when I'd done wrong.
Daddy's hands, weren't always gentle
But I've come to understand.
There was always love in Daddy's hands.

Daddy's hands were soft and kind when I was cryin'.
Daddy's hands, were hard as steel when I'd done wrong.
Daddy's hands, weren't always gentle
But I've come to understand.
There was always love .....
In Daddy's hands.
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, and yet I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bittersweet memories
That's all I have, and I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't you cry
Cause we both know, I'm not what you need

But, I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life (I hope life)
Treats you kind (treats you kind)
And I hope you have all you dream of
I wish you joy (I wish you joy)
And happiness (and happiness)
But above all this, I wish you love, oh

And I will always love you
I will always love you
Yes, I will always love you
I will always love you
(Instrumental)
Dying to please
dying to serve
I couldn't break out
didn't have the nerve
loverman
at anyones command
I woke up lonely
with a glass in my hand
And you found me when my circus was in town
Hallelujah for the singing clown

Walk with me
take my hand
spend a night
with the stupid man
I am yours if you can
fall in love
with the stupid man

Helpless soul
in a web of love
I didn't get a thing
I couldn't get enough
drunken tears
from paranoid eyes
promises came out lies
And you found me
when my ship was about to go down
And you carried me back on solid ground

Walk with me
take my hand
spend the night
with a stupid man
I am yours if you can
fall in love
with the stupid man

Scrap book memories
from a life that has been dead
tells me there is no one to blame and therefore
no one to forgive

Walk with me
take my hand
spend a night
with the stupid man
I am yours if you can
fall in love
with the stupid man
Everywhere you look
You can write a book
On the trouble of a woman and a man
But you can not impose
You can't stick your nose
Into something that you don't understand

But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
Who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
And who's car is parked next door

I thought I knew her well
I really couldn't tell
That she had another lover on her mind
You see it felt so right
When she held me tight
How could I be so blind

But still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
Who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door

A heart is on the line
Each and every time
Love is stolen in the shadows of the night
Though it's wrong all along
It keeps goin' on
As long as you keep in outta sight

Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
And who's being true
Who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door

Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
And who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door

Still you wonder
Who's cheatin' who
And who's being true
And who don't even care anymore
It makes you wonder
Who's doin' right with someone tonight
Who's car is parked next door
This time
I wont show I'm vulnerable
This time
I won't give in first
This time
I will hold out with my love
This time
I will not be hurt

I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
I'm gonna treat me right
I'm gonna make you say
That you love me first
And you'll be the one
with the most to lose tonight

This time
I'm gonna keep my heart locked safe inside
This time
I'm gonna be the one
To win your love
your affection
To hide my fear of rejection
This time
From this moment
Life has begun
From this moment
You are the one
Right beside you
Is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment
I have been blessed
I live only
For your happiness
And for your love
I’d give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can’t wait to live my life with you
I can’t wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams
Came true
Because
Of you
From this moment
As long as I live
I will love you
I promise you this
There is nothing
I wouldn’t give
From this moment on

Oh

You’re the reason I believe in love
And you’re the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams
Came true
Because
Of you
From this moment
As long as I live
I will love you
I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn’t give
From this moment
I will love you
As long as I live
From this moment
On
I brought flowers to your door last ni-ight.
I done you wrong and I wanna make it ri-ight.
You say I'm not welcome here,
I know it oughta be perfectly clear.
But I can't help but wonder what it might be like.....

(Chorus)
If I had two dozen roses,
And an older bottle of wine.
If I really coulda hung the moon,
Would you change your mind?

If I could cry a little harder.
And get a little less sleep at night.
If I had two dozen roses,
Would it change your mind?

Oh I musta been a fool back then.
To lose somethin' that you can't have again.
I've done all that I know to do.
and second guess my every move.
But I can't help but wonder how it might have been--

(Chorus)
If I had two dozen roses,
And an older bottle of wine.
If I really coulda hung the moon,
Would you change your mind?

If I could cry a little harder.
And get a little less sleep at night.
If I had two dozen roses,
Would it change your mind?

If I could cry a little harder,
And get a little less sleep at night.
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind?
Baby, would you change your mind?
Oh, baby would you change your mind..?
Girl, you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
And showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keep me hangin' on

Ain't no glamour in this tinsleland of lost and wasted lives
Painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh, but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave

And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keep me hangin' on

Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
It's the only thing that keep me hangin' on
It's the only thing that keep me hangin' on
It's the only thing that keep me hangin' on
Well I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well I'd been here for 2 long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Taking care of Ol Red

Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged tracking machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
And I smiled when I heard 'em turn Red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south

And the warden sang
Come on somebody
Why don't you run
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern
Get my gun
Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes

Now there's red haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out
Got a cool little chick named Rocking Millie.
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive, too.

Mama, mama, look at Uncle Joe
Doing the hand jive with sister Flo.
Grandma gave baby sister a dime;
Said, "Do that hand jive one more time."

Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive,
Do that crazy jive.

Doctor and a lawyer and an Indian chief,
They all dig that crazy beat.
Way-Out Willie gave them all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet.

Chorus

Willie and Millie got married last fall.
They had a little Willie junior and that ain't all.
Well, the kids got crazy and it's plain to see,
Doing the hand jive on T.V.

Chorus
I don't want another heartbreak,
I don't need another turn to cry.
No, I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby,'Hello.' Oh no, 'Goodbye.'
But you got me like a rocket shootin' straight across the sky.

It's the way you love me,
It's a feelin' like this.
It's centrifugal motion,
it's perpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment.
It's 'Ah, impossible.'
This kiss, this kiss.
Unstoppable.
This kiss, this kiss.

BOO!!!

Cinderella said to Snow White
'How does love get so off course?
Oh, all I wanted was a white knight with a good heart,
soft touch, fast horse.'
Ride me off into the sunset, baby I'm forever yours.

It's the way you love me,
it's a feelin' like this.
It's centrifugal motion,
it's perpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment.
It's 'Ah, unthinkable.'
This kiss, this kiss.
Unsinkable.
This kiss, this kiss.

You can kiss me in the moonlight on a rooftop under the sky.
Oh, you can kiss me with the windows open while the rain comes pouring inside.
Oh, kiss me in sweet slow motion,
let's let everything slide.
You've got me floating, you've got me flying.

It's the way you love me,
it's a feelin' like this.
It's centrifugal motion,
it's perpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment.
It's 'Ah, subliminal.'
This kiss, this kiss.
It's criminal.
This kiss, this kiss.

It's the way you love me baby,
it's the way you love me darling, yeah.

It's the way you love me,
it's a feelin' like this.
It's centripetal motion,
it's perpetual bliss.
It's that pivotal moment.
It's 'Ah, subliminal.'
This kiss, this kiss.
It's criminal.
This kiss, this kiss.

It's the way you love me baby,
it's the way you love me darling, yeah.

 Georgia, Georgia,
 The whole day through
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 I'm say Georgia
 Georgia
 A song of you
 Comes as sweet and clear
 As moonlight through the pines

 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you

 I said Georgia,
 Ooh Georgia, no peace I find
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 Other arms reach out to me

Take me in your arms and rock me
Ah-aaaaaah, yeah
Take me in your arms and rock me
Ah-aaaaaah-aaaaaah
All the gold in California
Is in a bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else’s name
So if you’re dreaming about California
It don’t matter at all where you played before,
California’s a brand new game

Trying to be a hero, winding up a zero
Can scar a man forever, right down to your soul
Living on the spot light, can kill a man out right
Cause everything that glitters is not gold

And all the gold in California
Is in a bank in the middle of Beverly Hills
In somebody else’s name
So if you’re dreaming about California
It don’t matter at all where you played before,
California’s a brand new game

GIVE ME ONE MORE LAST CHANCE

She was standing at the front door
when I came home last night
with a Good Book in her left hand
and a rolling pin in her right
she said you'd come home for the last time
with the whiskey on your breath
if you don't listen to my preaching boy
I'm gonna have to beat you half to death

Give me just a one more last chance
before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
it's the best that i can do
were just some good ol boys
a making noise
I ain't runnin around on you
Give me just a one more last chance
before you say we're through

first she hit my glasses
because ya know that I can't see
she said you ain't going nowhere boy
til you spend a little time with me
then the boys called from the honky tonk
said there's a party going on down here
well she might have took my car keys
but she forgot about my old John Deere

Gimme just a one more last chance
before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
it's the best that i can do
were just some good ol boys
making noise
I ain't runnin round on you
Gimme just a one more last chance
before you say we're through
SOLO
Gimme just one more last chance
before you say we're through
I know I drive you crazy baby
it's the best that I can do
were just some good ol boys
making noise
I ain't runnin around on you
Gimme just a one more last chance
before you say we're through

give me just one more last chance
before you say we're through
Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder
But that was years ago
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder
But where she's now, I don't know
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year
That spins my head around
Takes me back, makes me wonder
What she's doin' now

CHORUS

'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows... what she's doin' now

Just for laughs, I dialed her old number
But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same
I took a walk in the evenin' wind
To clear my head somehow
But tonight I lie here thinkin'

CHORUS x 2
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she walks by, the men folks get engrossed,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she winks an eye, the bread slice turn to toast,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she got a lot, of what they call the most,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it, she was born to please,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
And if she's got, a figure made to squeeze,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
Won't you kindly be aware, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it,
If she mesmerizes, every mother's son,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,


If she's smiling, beefsteak become well done,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
She makes grand pa feel like twenty one,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it, she was born to please,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
And if I go to her, on bended knees,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
Won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it,
I can't help it,
Because I'm hoping, obviously,
That some day, the answer would be,
The girl can't help it, she's in love with me,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it.
He's flying high tonight
He's got a brand new lover
Here you come a-runnin'
You're looking for some cover
I know you're sad and lonely
I know you're feeling blue
You miss him so much
Won't let me get to close to you

CHORUS:
Oh he ain't worth missin'
Oh we should be kissin'
Stop all this foolish wishin'
He ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
Girl you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missin'

You know I'm here to save you
But you ain't through cryin' yet
Look at your pretty face
All red and soakin' wet
I'm gonna try to make him
Just a memory
Come on baby let's get started
First thing you got to see

CHORUS:
Oh he ain't worth missin'
Oh we should be kissin'
Stop all this foolish wishin'
He ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
Girl you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missin'

If you need someone to hold you
Someone to ease your pain
Well I'll be holding steady
Girl when you get ready
I'm gonna show you
Love is a good thing
Yeah, love is a good thing

CHORUS:
Oh he ain't worth missin'
Oh we should be kissin'
Stop all that foolish wishin'
Ooh the boy ain't worth missin'
I know your head is turnin'
I know your heart is burnin'
Girl you gotta listen
Don't you know he ain't worth missin'

CHORUS:
Oh he ain't worth missin'
Oh we should be kissin'
Stop all that foolish wishin'
He ain't worth missin'

I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down.
I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

I awakened this morning
I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes
Now they are gone
As I looked at my life
It was barren and so bare
Without love I had nothing, nothing at all

Without love
I had nothing
Without love I had nothing, nothing at all
I had conquered the world
But what then did I have?
Without love I had nothing, nothing at all

I once had a sweetheart
Who loved only me
There was nothing that she would not give, no no
I was blind to her goodness and I just could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Without love
I had nothing
Without love I had nothing, nothing at all
I had conquered the world
But what then did I have?
Without love I had nothing, nothing at all

(Steve Gibb)

While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the night can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me!

Set on you

All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, ev'ry note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are apart
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
[INSTRUMENTAL]
I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions
were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey
Baby what do you say we just get lost

Now here I am again in this mean old town,
And you're so far away from me.
Now where are you when the sun goes down,
You're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Alright.

I'm tired of being in love and being all alone,
When you're so far away from me.
I'm tired of making out on the telephone,
Cause you're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Alright.

And I get so tired when I have to explain,
That you're so far away from me.
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain,
And you're so far away from me.

You're so far away from me,
So far I just can't see.
You're so far away from me,
You're so far away from me.
Check it out.

So far away.
You're so far away from me.
(You're so far.)
Alright.
(You're so far.)
Yes, you're so far away from me.
Well, I ain't afraid of dyin', it's the thought of being dead
I want to go on being me once my eulogy's been read
Don't spread my ashes out to sea, don't lay me down to rest
You can put my mind at ease if you fill my last request

(Chorus)
Prop me up beside the juke box if I die
Lord, I want to go to heaven, but I don't want to go tonight
Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die

Just let my headstone be a neon sign
Just let it burn in memory of all of my good times
Fix me up with a mannequin, just remember, I like blondes
I'll be the life of the party, even when I'm dead and gone

(Chorus)
Prop me up beside the juke box if I die
Lord, I want to go to heaven, but I don't want to go tonight
Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die

Just make your next selection, and while you're still in line
You can pay your last respects one quarter at a time

(Chorus)
Prop me up beside the juke box if I die
Lord, I want to go to heaven, but I don't want to go tonight
Fill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand
Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die

Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die (Repeat line and fade)
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm ok
But that's not what gets me

[Chorus:]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder
Getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus 2x]
'Midnight in Montgomery, silver eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudi suit and haunting haunted eyes
He said 'Friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone
Was he ever really there

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
When the wind is right, you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

I climbed back on my eagle
Took one last look around
Through red tail lights
The shadow moved slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I could hear that whistle moan
I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whippoorwill
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind it's right, you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there
He's always singing there
Hank's always singing there'
TIM McGRAW LYRICS

"She's My Kind Of Rain"

She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

She sits quietly there
Like water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain
Bobby played his guitar on the hard side of town
Where it's hard for a poor boy to find the money
He had dedication, he had the heart and soul
Somehow knew he was born to play

People say get a real job support your family
Cause there's no future on the road your takin'
But he never said a word, the dreamer just kept on
Late at night you could hear him say
(he'd say)

Chorus:
I'm gonna be somebody,
one of these days I'm gonna break these chains
I'm gonna be somebody, someday,
you can bet your hard earned dollar I will

The road was a struggle,
took him ten years to the top
and now he's number one on the stage and the radio
still he can't believe how people come from miles around
when it seems like only yesterday
when he would say

Chorus

Bobby played his hometown, one full moon August night
when He heard a voice in the front row singin
It was a sandy-haired River boy with same ole hungry eyes
he Looked up at Bobby and said

Chorus

you know i will yeah yeah

Chorus

Oh yeah
You can bet your hard earned dollar I will
Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
You've been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get

Desperado
Oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
And you're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, open the gate
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, let somebody love you
better let somebody love you
Before it's too late
I was thumbing from Montgomery
I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dress like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son

Well I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride

Well he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said this is where you get off boy
I'm goin' back to Alabam
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said mister many thanks
He said you don't have to call me mister mister
The whole world calls me Hank

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride
Well, my momma met my daddy down in Alabama
They tied the knot so here I am
Born on the bayou on the Texas Line
Loved Louisanana and raised on Jabalaya

Now before I could walk I had a guitar in my hand
By the time I could talk I had my own band
Went on the road when I was eight years old
When I turned fifteen I was stealing the show
Money to burn and the girls were pretty
It didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie

When I was eighteen I went to Hollywood
I met Elvis, Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted in the California sun
A red cadillac having to much fun

Now we were playing them halls and jamming then
Until they moved me on over to MGM
They said this is the boy we've been telling you about
He lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
He said son, have we got a deal for you
Gonna make you a star give you fifty thousand too.
I told him my Momma didn't raise no fool.
I'll take your money
I'll make you a movie
But I can tell ya right now
I am born to boogie

Well, my name is Bocephus
I drink whiskey by the gallon
And I never back down and I love a good challenge
What I do now is what I did then
I like to get down with all my rowdy friends

Now I can be sweet and I can be
Mean I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chromo
My guitar is steal
I you think I won't then believe me I will
Get down on you baby because I ain't no rookie
I was put here to party and I was born to boogie
There's an Elvis movie on the marquee sign
We've all seen at least three times
Everybody's broke, Bobby's got a buck
Put a dollars worth of gas in his pickup truck
We're going' ninety miles an hour down a dead end road
What's the hurry, son... where you gonna go?
We're gonna howl at the moon, shoot out the light
It's a small town Saturday night
It's a small town Saturday night

Lucy's got her lipstick on a little too bright
Bobby's gettin' drunk and lookin' for a fight
Liquor on his breath and trouble on his mind
And Lucy's just a kid along for the ride
Got a six-pack of beer and a bottle of wine
Gotta be bad just to have a good time
They're gonna howl at the moon, shoot out the light
It's a small town Saturday night
It's a small town Saturday night

Bobby told Lucy, "The world ain't round...
Drops off sharp at the edge of town
Lucy, you know the world must be flat
'Cause when people leave town, they never come back"
They go ninety miles an hour to the city limits sign
Put the pedal to the metal 'fore they change their mind
They howl at the moon, shoot out the light
It's a small town Saturday night

They howl at the moon, shoot out the light
Yeah, it's a small town Saturday night
It's a small town Saturday night
It's a small town Saturday night
She's sun and rain, she's fire and ice
A little crazy but it's nice
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone
'Cause she'll rage just like a river
Then she'll beg you to forgive her
She's every woman that I've ever known

She's so New York and then L.A.
And every town along the way
She's every place that I've never been
She's makin love on rainy nights
She's a stroll through Christmas lights
And she's everything I want to do again

It needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
For when it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

No it needs no explanation
'Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She's on both sides of the fence

She's anything but typical
She's so unpredictable
Oh but even at her worst she ain't that bad
She's as real as real can be
And she's every fantasy
Lord she's every lover that I've ever had
And she's every lover that I've never had
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

There'll be parties for hosting

I was feelin' the blues,
I was watching the news,
When this fella came on the TV.
He said, "I'm tellin' you
That science has proven
That heartaches are healed by the sea."
Well, that got me goin'
Without even knowin'
And I packed right up and drove down.
Now I'm on a roll
And I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town.

So, bring me two piña coladas.
I want one for each hand.
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan.
Oh, we never leave dry land.
Hey, troubles? I forgot 'em.
I buried 'em in the sand.
So, bring me two piña coladas.
She said good-bye to her good timin' man. (Good-bye!)

Oh, now I've gotta say
That the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind
By leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings.
Now, I've got a smile
That goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam.
And I've gotta say
That I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home.

So, bring me two piña coladas.
I gotta have one for each hand.
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan.
Oh, we never leave dry land.
Hey, troubles? I forgot 'em.
I buried 'em in the sand.
So, bring me two piña coladas.
She said good-bye to her good timin' man.

Bring me, bring me two piña coladas.
(Yeah!) I want one for each hand.
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan.
Oh, we never leave dry land.
(No troubles. I forgot 'em) Troubles? I forgot 'em.
(I buried 'em in the sand) I buried her in the sand. (Ha ha!)
So, bring me two piña coladas.
And say hello to her good timin' man.

Bring me two piña coladas.
I gotta have one for each hand.
Le's all set sail with Captain Morgan.
And we will never leave dry land. (Ha ha!)
Hey, troubles? I forgot 'em.

I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my T.V.
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away


Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going thru a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?
Have you forgotten?
Verse 1:
Just about a mile off-a one-oh-nine,
There's a little church sittin' back in the pines.
I promised that girl she was gonna be mine;
I wouldn't be surprised if she was standin' there cryin'.

Chorus:
Wo-ah, I didn't know this bored-out Ford could go so slow.
Wo-ah, You got to put your foot down on the floor,
'Yeah we've been rocking all night, now, don't you know
You gotta get me to the church on Cumberland Road.

Verse 2:
Billy's passed out in the back, But I think he's alive.
Bobby's got his head hangin' over the side.
Here we are doin' only ninety-five.
What's the matter with you, man? I thought you said you could drive!

(Chorus)

Verse3:
Sweeter than the dew on a honeysuckle vine,
Hotter than noon on the Fourth of July,
Cutest little girl that I ever have known
Waitin' at the church on Cumberland Road.

(Chorus)
Sun coming up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Starin' at the faces in her rearview mirror
Looking at the promise of the Promised Land
One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up going to prison
One just might be president

Only in America
Dreaming in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Sun going down on an La. freeway
Newlyweds in the back of a limousine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is everything
She came out here to be an actress
He was a singer in a band
They just might go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been
Chorus

Only in America
Where we dream in red, white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to
We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Yeah only in America
Where we dream in red, white and blue
Yeah we dream as big as we want to
I may look like a city slicker,
Shinin' up through his shoes.
Underneath I'm just a cotton picker,
Pickin' out a mess of blues.

Show me where I start.
Find a horse and cart.
I'm just a country boy,
Country boy at heart.

I may look like a bank teller,
Pushing facts in a file.
But I'd rather be a haul collar,
Shooing foot home in style.

Show me where I start.
Find a horse and cart.
I'm just a country boy,
Country boy at heart.

Ridin' down the road in my pick-up truck
Ya' better be ready 'cause I'm pickin' you up
With a full moon a shinin' and a little bit a' luck
We'll run out outta gas and maybe get stuck

We could get lost baby I don't care
I ain't worried as long as you're there
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, sittin' next to me
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, next to me

Barbecue chicken in aluminum foil
Just enough money for my gas and oil
Who needs your shrimp and your caviar
I'd sooner have you just the way you are

Rich people got their money to hold
Mansion on the hill and diamonds and gold
It can't compare as far as I can see
Next to you sittin' next to me
There ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to you, next to me

Radio playin' our favorite song
I'll change the station if the news comes on
When the signal ain't comin' in too strong
We'll make our own music honey all night long

If the Good Lord's willin' when we're old and gray
The kids are grown up and moved away
We'll be rockin' there side by side
With barbeque chicken and the tv guide

Well, there ain't no place that I'd rather be
Next to, sittin' next to me

No, there ain't no place that I'd rather be

Suppose I called you up tonight
And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think
I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realize you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too
And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

CHORUS:
I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling
Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I return
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the table's finally turned
Would you say

CHORUS:
I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

And now I've foudn somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again
Could be holding you tonight
Could quit doing wrong,start right
You don't care about what I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
A least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, listen close so you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, hurtin' me know don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here I don't feel a thing
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down 'cause more is best
It's all an endless process

(Well) I miss Mayberry
Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke
Where everything is black and white
Picking on a six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
Bye, bye

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting
Through the trees as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly
But I got two feet that get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

(Well) I miss Mayberry
Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke
Where everything is black and white
Picking on a six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
Bye, bye

Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dirt road
Not even listed on a map
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back

(Well) I miss Mayberry
Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke
Where everything is black and white
Picking on a six string
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name
Watching the clouds roll by
Bye, bye

Bye, bye

I don't believe in superstars organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold the certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong that north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west and being first is always best
But I believe in love I believe in babies I believe in mom and dad and I believe in you

I don't believe that heaven waits for only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love he's down below he's up above
He's watchin' people everywhere he knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man sometimes I wonder who I am
But I believe in love I believe in music I believe in magic and I believe in you

Well I know with all my certainty what's going on with you and me is a good thing
It's true I believe in you
Well I don't believe virginity is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights that black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply the rising cost of gettin' by
But I believe in love I believe in old folks I believe in children and I believe in you

Just off of the beaten path

Nobody's in a rat race

Down Home

Down Home
A mans good word and a hand shake are all you need

If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up down home

In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered round on a checkered board
Old men telling lies and crownin' kings

Kids drivin' round the old town square
Cops roll down int he cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

When I was a boy I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised

Down Home

You're lucky - I'm a civilized man

You're so lucky - I'm a civilized man

A poison arrow right from the start

Went down to zero

Usin' hoodoo voodoo to start the fire again

Now you asked me to forget all you put me thru

When you know as well as I you got it comin' to you.
Now you're lucky - I'm a civilized man. . . .
Using hoodoo voodoo to start the fire again.

Well it's been a long time glad to see your face
I knew we'd meet again another time another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
You'd better grab a chair and a couple of beers
Lookin' good in you 3 piece suit
You know, I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one to follow the light and you look like you're doing alright

Been singin' for my rent and singin' for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper rung
I'm stuck in the middle where money gets tight
But I guess I'm doin' alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight so I guess I'm doin' alright
o - oh, o - oh, I'm alright
Got a good old friend here with me tonight and I guess I'm doin' alright

Well we had a lot of dreams when we were younger
They thought we were crazy but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends, skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our ____
We lost touch, we lost in love
We lost our minds when things got tough, but
Beatin' time is a losin' fight and I guess I'm doin' alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight so I guess I'm doin' alright
o - oh, o - oh, I'm alright
Got a good old friend here with me tonight and I guess I'm doin' alright
Well I guess I'm doin' alright

(guitar and steel guitar solos)

Well I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Just send a fax or send me a letter or give me a call that would even be better
Give the kids a kiss for me and say hello to the family
And tell them all my future's lookin' bright
Well, I miss 'em but I'm doin' alright
I said I miss 'em but I'm doin' alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day not a cloud in sight so I guess I'm doin' alright
o - oh, o - oh, I'm alright
Got a good old friend here with me tonight and I guess I'm doin' alright
Well I guess I'm doin' alright
I'm doin' alright
Charlie's got a gold watch
Don't seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of drivin'
Up and down the interstate

But Charlie's had a good life
And Charlie's got a good wife
And after tonight she'll no longer
Be countin' the days

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life
With the one that he loves

They'll buy a Winnebago
Set out to find America
They'll do a lot of catchin' up
A little at a time

With pieces of the old dream
They're gonna light the old flame
Doin' what they please
Leavin' every other reason behind

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life
With the one that he loves

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life
With the one that he loves
We didn't know that times were lean
Round our house the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Chopin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had.

As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt - the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand.

Chorus:
We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.

When Sunday mornings rolled around
We dressed up in hand-me downs
Just in time, to gather with the church
Sometimes I think how long it's been
And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

Chorus X2

We Were Walkin' In High Cotton.
Turn left at the old hotel
I know this boulevard much too well
It hasn't changed since I've been gone
Oh this used to be my way home
They paved the road through the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed it good
It was gettin' rough
Someone finally complained enough
Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while
Oh it's plain to see the only thing missin' is me

CHORUS:
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my backyard
There's the window to the room
Where she lays her pretty head
I planted that tree out by the fence
Not long after we moved in
There's my kids and that's my wife
But who's that man runnin' my life

If I pulled in would it cause a scene?
They're not really expecting me
Those kids have been through hell
I hear they've adjusted well
Turn around in the neighbor's drive
I'd be hard to recognize in this pickup truck
It's just an ol' fixer up
Drive away one more time
A lot of things runnin' through my mind
I guess the less things change
The more they never seem the same

REPEAT CHORUS

(Yeah) REPEAT CHORUS

(Who's that man) Who's that man runnin' my life
(Who's that man)
(Who's that man) Who's that man runnin' my life
(Who's that man) Mmmhhhmmmm
(Who's that man) Who's that man runnin' my life
(Who's that man)
(Who's that man)
I remember when I was a lad,
times were hard and things were bad.
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud.
Just poor people, that's all we were.
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt.
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud.

Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
Singing seems to help a troubled soul.
One of these days and it won't be long.
I'll rejoin them in a song.
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne.
No, the circle won't be broken.
By and by, Lord, by and by.

Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

Now I remember after work,
Mama would call in all of us.
You could hear us singing for a country mile.
Now little brother has done gone on.
But, I'll rejoin him in a song.
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.

Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
Cause singing seems to help a troubled soul.
One of these days and it won't be long,
I'll rejoin them in a song.
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne.
Oh, no the circle won't be broken.
By and by, Lord, by and by.

Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.
Well I'm married to the good life
I said I'd be a good wife
When I put on this ring
I drive a new Mercedes
I play tennis with the ladies
I buy all the finer things
But all that don't mean nothing
When you can't get a good night's loving

Oh little rock
Think I'm gonna have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Oh little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock

Well I wonder if he'll miss me
He doesn't even kiss me
When he comes home at night
He never calls me honey
But he sure loves his money
And I'm the one who pays the price
But when he finds this ring he'll see
He keeps everything but me

Oh little rock
Think I'm gonna have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Oh little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock

Oh little rock
Think I'm gonna have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Oh little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm gonna find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock
You ran cryin' to the bedroom
I ran off to the bar
Another piece of heaven gone to hell
The words we spoke in anger
Just tore my world apart
And I sat there feelin' sorry for myself
Then an old man sat down beside me
And looked me in the eye
And he said, "Son, I know what you're goin' through.
"You ought'a get down on your knees
And thank your lucky stars
That you've got someone to go home to.

"You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
'Til you've lived through the story
That's still livin' in me.
"You don't know about sadness
'Til you've faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'Til it's chiseled in stone."

So I brought these pretty flowers
Hopin' you would understand
Sometimes a man is such a fool
Those golden words of wisdom
From the heart of that old man
Showed me I ain't nothin' without you

You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
'Til you've lived through the story
That old man just told me
And you don't know about sadness
'Til you've faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'Til it's chiseled in stone
You don't know about lonely
'Til it's chiseled in stone
Take me now baby here as I am
Hold me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now,
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turns and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight there are two lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Red Lipstick letter
'Cross the mirror this morning.
Said, &amp;amp;quot;Good-bye, baby.&amp;amp;quot;
You left without warning.
Like a thief in the night,
You ran away with my heart.
I can't believe my eyes,
Must be a bad dream.
You always said
We had a good thing.
You never once let on
That we were falling apart.

That ain't no way to go.
Girl, it just ain't right.
Don't you think
That I deserve
To hear you say goodbye?
That ain't no way to go.
Was it all a lie?
After all this time,
That ain't no way to go.

Getting nowhere,
I'm tired of thinking.
Guess I'll do a little
Wishful drinking.
Make a whiskey wish
Upon a star.
Train whistle blowing
Down the tracks.
Lonesome sound says
She ain't coming back.
It's such a cold blow
From out of the dark.

That ain't no way to go.
Girl, it just ain't right.
Don't you think
That I deserve
To hear you say goodbye?
That ain't no way to go.
Was it all a lie?
After all this time,
That ain't no way to go.
She married when she was 20
She thought she was ready
Now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
Now she's just wondering what she's living for
Now she's feelin that there's something more

(chorus)
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done?
Is there life beyond her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't wanna leave she's just wondering is there life out there?

She's always lived for tomorrow
But she's never learned how to live for today
Oh she's dying to try something foolish
To do something crazy or just get away
Oh something for herself for a change

(chorus)

There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then?
Oh she looks out her window and she wonders again

(chorus)

Oh, she doesn't wanna leave she's just wondering is there life out there?
Sometimes the morning coffee's way too strong.
and Sometimes what she says she says all wrong.

Right or Wrong, she's there beside me,
Like only a friend would be!
And that's close enough to perfect for me.

now, She's been known to wear her pants to tight.
And drinkin� puts her out just like a light.
Heaven knows she's not an angel,
but she'd really like to be.
And that's close enough to perfect for me.

She kisses me each mornin�
And smiles a sleepy smile!
She don't have to say it.
I can see it in her eyes!

Don't you worry about my woman,
And what you think she aught to be!
She's close enough to perfect for me!

Sometimes she gets down and starts to cry!
But then again a lady has a right.

She's everything I ever wanted!
She's all I'll ever need!
She's close enough to perfect for me!

She kisses me each mornin�,
And smiles a sleepy smile!
She don't have to say it.
I can see it in her eyes!

Don't you worry about my woman,
And what you think she aught to be!
She's close enough to perfect for me!

Whooooa�She's close enough to perfect�for me!
Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt.
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking.
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking.
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken.
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down.

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging.
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing.
Then I headed down the street,
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned.
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone.
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down.
If he brings you happiness
Then i wish you all the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if he ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls

Si te quire de verdad
Y te da felicidad
Te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos
Pero si te hace llorar
A mime puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando treste estas

I'll be there anytime
You need me by your side
To drive away every teardrop that you cried

And if he ever leaves you blue
Just remember, I love you
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Come out, Virginia. Don't let me wait.
You Catholic girls start much too late,
Oh, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate.
I might as well be the one.

Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray.
They built you a temple and locked you away,
Oh, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done.
Only the good die young.
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might've heard I run with a dangerous crowd.
We ain't too pretty. We ain't too proud.
We might be laughing a bit too loud,
Oh, but that never hurt no one.

So come on, Virginia, show me a sign,
Send up a signal. I'll throw you a line.
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun,
Darlin' only the good die young
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation.
You got a brand new soul
Mmmmm, and a cross of gold,

But, Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information.
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary.
Oh oh ooh

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait.
Some say it's better but I say it ain't.
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
The sinners are much more fun,
Ya know that only the good die young
Oh oh oh, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation.
Oh, she never cared for me,
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh oh oh

Come out, come out, come out Virginia, don't let me wait.
You Catholic girls start much too late,
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate.
I might as well be the one
You know that only the good die young
Tell ya baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young
Woo-oo-oo, hoo, hoo
I've never ask you where you're goin'
I've never ask you where you've been
I've never called and checked your story
You stayed out with all your freinds
I've never tried to catch you lyin'
I didn't want to know the truth
I'd rather go on lovin' blind girl
Than go on lovin' without you

I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' it's you could never be true
I just don't wanna know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then

I've always said what I don't know
Couldn't hurt as bad as leavin' you
Turns out I knew what I was thinkin'
It ain't an easy thing to do
Well I guess I should be goin'
I sure found out too much to stay
Please don't say your sorry
I might wait another day

I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I wish I could start this whole thing over again
I'm not sayin' it's you could never be true
I just don't wanna know how it ends
You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hands
I'd still look like a fool in front of your friends
Yeah I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then

You'd still have my heart in the palm of your hand
I'd still look like a fool in front of your freinds
Yeah I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then
Yeah I wish somehow I didn't know now what I didn't know then
I haven't seen you in forever,
aw you haven't changed a bit.
you didn't think that I remembered,
how could I forget?

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star
in that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.

To this day I still taste that first kiss.
How I prayed it wouldn't end,
and in a way seeing you like this
I guess it never really did.

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star

One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,

If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever.. oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now

We're moving 'round and 'round
Can't hear a single sound
And when I hit the ground
I heard a ringing sound
Uh-huh-huh
I heard a ringing sound
And my head hit the ground
Uh-huh-huh
Inside I'm upside down

You live with so much carelessness
'Cause no one takes you serious
That makes you feel so dangerous
You wish you never was
But you can't see

And if you feel there's no one else
That you're all alone, you're by yourself
Your life is like a broken shell
It doesn't really matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Knowing you can't see

Inside I feel so bad
So low I feel so sad
Feels like I'm going mad
Best friend I've ever had
Uh-huh-huh
Feels like I'm going mad
Best friend I've ever had
Uh-huh-huh
So low I feel so sad

You live with so much carelessness
'Cause no one takes you serious
And now you think you're dangerous
You never was but you can't see
And if you feel there's no one else
You're all alone and by yourself
Your life is like a broken shell
It doesn't really matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter to me
Knowing you can't see

Upside down [x 10]
Back and forth, I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed

Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away
But I know, there's a picture beneath

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens...
Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Layin' face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight
Droplets of "yes" and "no"
In an ocean of "maybe"

From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
From the top, another downhill slope of mine
But I know, the equilibrium's there

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens
Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Back and forth, I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark
Sometimes I think I'm blind
Or I may be just paralyzed

Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away
But I know, there's a picture beneath

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens...
Because I'm somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I'm somewhere in between
My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together
Chorus:
You've got to have an ace in the hole
A little secret that nobody knows
Life is a gamble a game we all play
but you need to save something for a rainy day
You've got to learn to play your cards right
If you expect to win in life
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole

If you're headed down a one way street
and you're not sure its the way you wanna go
In money or love or all the above
Have a little more than what you show
When life deals out a suprise
Have a few suprises of your own
No matter what you do
No matter where you go
You've got to have an ace in the hole

(Chorus)

Don't put it all on the line just for one roll
You've got to have an ace in the hole

No matter what you do
No matter where you go
you've got to have an ace in the hole
Written by Billy Yates and Mike Curtis

(Chorus)
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I made

I was tempted
By an early age I found
I liked drinkin'
Oh, and I never turned it down
There were loved ones
But I turned them all away
Now I'm living and dying
With the choices I made

(Repeat Chorus)

I guess I'm payin'
For the things that I have done
If I could go back
Oh, Lord knows I'd run
But I'm still losin'
This game of life I play
Living and dying
With the choices I made

(Repeat Chorus)

Living and dying
With the choices I made
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she gives him a smile
And he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me I'm feelin' a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

So the letters came
From an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart
It might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
He said when it's gettin kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home


One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said folks would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read that nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home
I was standing in line at the city bus stop
Soaked to the skin from ev'ry rain drop
I see you driving by just like a phantom jet
With your arm around some little brunette
You say you won't be home because you're working late
Honey, I'm no fool, you've been out on a date
The lipstick on your collar gives the game away
It's strawberry red and mine's pink rose

(Chorus)

Have mercy on me
You treat me so bad I'm in misery
It's breaking my heart, can't you see
Baby, baby have mercy on me

Well I called you up on the telephone
I could hear you was playin' Haggard and Jones
I knew right then that there was something wrong
There's only one reason you play cheatin' songs

(Repeat Chorus)

Went to the bank with my little check book
The cashier he gave me the strangest look
He said you ain't got no money 'cause you're over drawn
Your man took it all and he's done gone

(Repeat Chorus)
I've never seen the inside of a bar room
Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said if you can't beat'em join'em
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on you're gonna see a different me

Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Cause your good girl's gonna go bad

I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey
In fact you'll hardly regonize your wife
I buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life

Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Because your good girl'd gonna go bad
Oh yeah your good girls gonna go bad
Those times I waited for you seem so long ago
I wanted you far too much to ever let you go
You know you never got by "I feel it too"
And I guess I never could stand to lose
It's such a pity to say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Could I have loved someone like the one I see in you
I remember the good times baby now, and the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
'Cause baby it's over now
No need to talk about it
It's not the same
My love for you's just not the same
And my heart, and my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love
And my love won't stand the pain
And my heart, and my heart
And my heart can't stand the strain
And my love, and my love
And my love...
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Now, could I have loved someone like the one I see in you
Yeah, I remember the good times baby now, and the bad times too
These last few weeks of holding on
The days are dull, the nights are long
Guess it's better to say
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye to you
Goodbye baby
So long darling
Goodbye to you
How do I,
Get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you,
What kind of life would that be?
Oh, I
Need you in my arms, need you to hold,
You're my world, my heart, my soul,
If you ever leave,
baby you would take away everything good in my life,

and tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know,
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go,
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I,O how do I live?

Without you,
There'd be no sun in my sky,
There would be no love in my life,
There'd be no world left for me.
And I,
Baby I don't know what I would do,
I'd be lost if I lost you,
If you ever leave,
Baby you would take away everything real in my life,

And tell me now,
How do I live without you?
I want to know,
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go,
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I,O how do I live?

If you ever leave,
Baby you would take away everything,
I need you with me,
Baby don't you know that you're everything,
Good in my life?

And tell me now,
How do I live without you,
I want to know,
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go,
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, how do I live?

How do I live without you?
The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon

The greatest man I never knew
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
And now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had

Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life

The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
S'been dead almost a year
He was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me
Guess he thought I knew
A time warp scene A cy-fi story A dirt coloured love Hey hope for glory I like to fight, I kill global oppression If I quit, no hope of redemption Blue eyes crying in the rain For how long Tomorrow people I laugh tomorrow gone For how long Tomorrow people Tomorrow people Well you know I'm free on arrival Left behind my babe, by guilt of survival I don't know where I'm runnin' to I lost my love, lost my hold, I lost my heaven too Blue eyes crying in the rain For how long Tomorrow people I laugh tomorrow gone For how long Tomorrow people Blue eyes crying in the rain For how long Tomorrow people I laugh tomorrow gone For how long, soon come Tomorrow people Tomorrow people Yah come on loud Now my life is truly misspent I said I'm here to tell you, to tell you That I won't repent World War III Death pain It's fate lets do it again Tomorrow man Tomorrow people Tomorrow man Tomorrow people Tomorrow man A time warp scene A ci-fy story (Tomorrow people) A dirt coloured sky (Tomorrow people) New hope for glory I like to fight I kill global oppression (Tomorrow people) When I quit, new hope for redemption (Tomorrow people) Blue eyes crying in the rain Tomorrow people I laugh tomorrow gone Tomorrow people Tomorrow people Tomorrow people Tomorrow people Tomorrow people
(Mary-Chapin Carpenter/Don Schlitz)

Well I woke up this morning stumbled out of my rack
I opened up the paper to the page in the back
It only took a minute for my finger to find
My daily dose of destiny, under my sign
My eyes just about popped out of my head
It said &amp;amp;quot;the stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed&amp;amp;quot;

I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
No Professor Doom gonna stand in my way
Mmmmm, I feel lucky today

Well I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying, &amp;amp;quot;girl, you better get back home&amp;amp;quot;

But I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away
Mmmmm, I feel lucky today

Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
I'd bought the house a double, and the waitress a new car
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner, trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
Hey the stars might lie, but the numbers never do

I feel lucky, oh oh oh, I feel lucky, yeah
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight

I feel lucky, brrrrr, I feel lucky, yeah
Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
Mmmmmm, I feel lucky today
I've been sittin' here stairin' at the clock on the wall
And I've been layin' here prayin'
Prayin' she won't call
It's just another call from home and you'll get it and be gone and I'll be cryin'

And I'll be beggin' you baby
Beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waitin'
My Heart on my sleeve
Oh for the next time we'll be here seems like a million years and I think I'm dyin'

What do I have to do to make you see
She can't love you like me

Why don't you stay
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of bein' lonely
Don't I give you what you need
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay

You keep tellin' me baby
There will come a time
When you will leave her arms
And forever be in mine
But I don't think that's the truth
And I don't like bein' used and I'm tired of waitin'

It's too much pain to have to bare
To love a man you have to share

Why don't you stay
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of bein' lonely
Don't I give you what you need
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay

I can't take it any longer but my will is gettin' stronger
And I think I know just what I have to do
I can't waste another minute
After all that I've put in it
I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you

So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine

Why don't you stay
I'm up off my knees
I'm so tired of bein' lonely
You can't give me what I need
When she begs you not to go
There is one thing you should know
I don't have to live this way

Baby why don't you stay
(Phil Vassar/Rory Michael Bourke) Boy you sure look good there standin' in the doorway in the sunset light Maybe I read you wrong thinkin' you could be my Mr. Right I was puttin' my heart and soul on the line Said you needed some time, just a little more time to make up your mind Well it's been long enough Time is up Bye bye love, I'll catch you later Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rearview mirror torn off I ain't never lookin' back. And that's a fact. I've tried all I can imagine I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye Don't think all those tears are gonna hold me here like they've done before You'll find what's left of us in a cloud of dust on highway 4 Baby what did you expect me to do Just sit around and wait on you Well I'm through watchin' you just skate around the truth And I know it sounds trite I've seen the light Bye bye love, I'll catch you later Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rearview mirror torn off 'Cause I ain't never lookin' back, and that's a fact. I've tried all I can imagine I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye I'd lost the game I guess I did my best to win the part Now I'm leavin' here with what's left of my heart. Bye bye, I'll catch you later Got a lead foot down on my accelerator and the rearview mirror torn off 'Cause I ain't never lookin' back. You can count on that. I've tried all I can imagine I've begged and pleaded in true lover's fashion I've got pride, I'm takin' it for a ride Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye Bye bye Ooh baby Oh oh Bye bye, bye bye my baby, bye bye
I told you I'd leave a light on,
In case you ever wanted to come back home,
You smiled and said you appreciate the gesture,
I took your every word to heart,
'Cause I can't stand us bein' apart,
And just to show how much I really miss ya,

(chorus)
Every light in the house is on,
The back yard's bright as the crack of dawn,
The front walk looks like runway lights,
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night,
Every light in the house is on,
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone,
Every light in the house is on,

If I should ever start forgetin',
I'll turn the lights off one by one,
So you can see that I agree It's over,
But until then I want you to know,
If you look south you'll see a glow,
Thats me waitin' at home each night to hold ya,

Every light in the house is on,
The back yard's bright as the crack of dawn,
The front walk looks like runway lights,
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night,
Every light in the house is on,
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone,
ooooh Every light in the house is on,
The back yard's bright as the crack of dawn,
The front walk looks like runway lights,
It's kinda like noon in the dead of night,
Every light in the house is on,
Just in case you ever do get tired of being gone,
Every light in the house is on.
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed the way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blind by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

(Ladies &amp;amp; gentleman Mr. Elton John)
I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal oh

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me
(Mr. Elton John)
I got my toes in the water, ass in the
sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today.

Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther.
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today.

Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night as the summer
drew to an end
They couldn't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Because my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar and I don't know if its her or the
rum

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today.

Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from the GA
Its where all the muchachas they call me &amp;quot;big poppa&amp;quot; when I throw pesos their
way
Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and play

Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
You got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay

Just gonna prop up by the lake
With my ass in a lawn chair
And toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today. Life is good today
I've been throwing horseshoes
Over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life
Searching for that four-leafed clover

Yet you ran with me,
Chasing my rainbows
And honey I love you, too
that's the way love goes.

That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
Its never old; it grows
Losing makes me sorry
well now, "Honey, don't worry."
dont u kno i love u too
that's the way love goes.

thats the way love goes babe
thats the music god made
for all the world to sing
it's never old it grows

losin makes me sorry
you say, honey i dont worry
i love you too
thats the way love goes
How do I get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh I, I need you in my arms
Need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul
If you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything good in my life.

Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There would be no world left for me and I ,
Baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby, you'd take away everything real in my life.

Chorus:
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive,
How do I
How do I
Oh, how do I live?

If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
Need you with me
Baby, don't you know
That your everything good in my life.

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever, survive
How do I
How do I
Oh, how do I live?

How do I live
Without you baby?
Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough, yeah,
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong.

Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby, let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right.

You'll control me
Oh, so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe I'll be fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But, I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you.

Uhhh

You'll control me
Oh, so boldly

Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
Just a come unwound

And that woman that I had
Wrapped around my finger just a come unwound.
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile
A rich old man
And she won't have to worry
She'll dress up all in lace and go in style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She is headed for the cheatin' side of town

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms; they fall together
She whispers that it's only for awhile
She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

You can't hide your lyin' eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't now way to hide your lyin' eyes

She gets up and pours herself a strong one,
And stares out at the stars up in the sky.
Another night, it's gonna be a long one.
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.

She wonders how it ever got this crazy.
She thinks about a boy she knew in school.
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy?
She's so far gone she feels just like a fool.

My oh my, you sure know how to arrange things.
You set it up so well, so carefully.
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things?
You're still the same old girl you used to be.

You can't hide your lyin eyes
And your smile is a thin disguise
I thought by now you'd realize
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes

I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound

Play me some songs about a ramblin' man, put a cold one in my hand,
'cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' cause I'll get all balled up
inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Sure enough about closing time, (I'm) about stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky-tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun come, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound

Play me some songs about a ramblin' man, put old Jim Beam in my hand
'cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't you play 'Your Cheatin' Heart' cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Yeah, old Hank's songs always make me feel low down
Driving down the interstate
Running 30 minutes late
Singing 'Margaritaville' and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude
With a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone.

He started yelling at me
Like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird
And then he was gone.

Some beach somewhere
There's a big umbrella
Casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing, warm breeze is blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere.

I circled the parking lot
Trying to find a spot
Just big enough
I could park my ol' truck
A man with a big cigar
Was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz
Came cruising up, and whipped right in.

Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go
When you've got all day to get there
There's cold Margaritas
And hot senoritas
Smiling with long dark hair
On somebeach, somewhere.

Well, I sat in that waiting room
Seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said the doc's ready for you
Your not gonna feel a thing
We'll give you some novacaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb.

Some beach, somewhere
There a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing, lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere.

On somebeach, somewhere...
When all our tears have reached the sea.
Part of you will live in me.
Way down deep inside my heart.
The days keep coming without fail.
A new wind is gonna find your sail.
That's where your journey starts.

You'll find better love,
Strong as it ever was,
Deep as the river runs,
Warm as the morning sun.
Please remember me.

Just like the waves down by the shore,
We're gonna keep on coming back for more.
Cause we don't ever wanna stop.
Out in this brave new world you seek
O'er the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top.

Repeat Chorus

Remember me when you're out walking
When snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor.
I can't hurt you anymore.

Repeat Chorus.
(Billy Kirsch/Steve Wariner)
One day shy of eight years old,
My Grandma passed away
I was a broken hearted little boy,
Blowing out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go
With a cold and lonesome rain
Momma smiled said don't be sad child,
Grandma's watchin you today

'Cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how you know she's watchin',
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes if you're lonely
Just remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of Heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me

Seasons come and seasons go,
Nothin' stays the same
I grew up fell in love,
Met a girl who took my name
Year by year we made a life
In this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together,
Lord I sure do miss her now

But there's holes in the floor of Heaven
And her tears are pourin' down
That's how I know she's watchin',
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely,
I remember she can see
There's holes in the floor of Heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me

Well my little girl is 23,
I walk her down the aisle
It's a shame her mom can't be here now
To see her lovely smile
They throw the rice, I catch her eye
As the rain starts comin' down
She takes my hand says daddy don't be sad
'Cause I know momma's watchin' now

And there's holes in the floor of Heaven
And her tears are pourin down
That's how you know she's watchin'
Wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
Yes,there's holes in the floor of Heaven
And she's watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
Watchin' over you and me
He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind.

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again.

Found love letters by his bed
Dated 19 and 62
He had underlined in red
Every single, I love you.

I went to see my friend today
Oh, but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years.

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today.

(Spoken)
Ya' know she came to see him one last time
Oh, we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good.

(Sang)
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today...

(Lyrics note: There are several lyrical versions of this song.
The only difference I can find is in the 3rd verse, the 1st line.
The alternate version reads Kept some letters by his bed.
Another difference is in the 4th verse ''I went to see my
friend today may be found saying ''I went to see him just today'')
[Intro]
DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAAAAA
DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DE-DUM-DE-DE-DUM, DE-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAA-DAAAA!

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same.

[Chorus:]
Cause I saddle up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling- Blanging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

And I saddle up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

[Spoken:]
I'm a thourough-bred
that's what she said
in the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road.
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
But her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of

And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says
Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

What? What?
Save A Horse Ride A Cowboy
Everybody says
Save a Horse Ride a cowboy.
[Chorus:]
I feel no shame
I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks

One thing I know
No matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul
In the boondocks

I can feel that
Muddy water runnin' through my veins
I can hear that
lullabye of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familar

[Chorus]

I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
And it calls to me like a warm wind blowin'

[Chorus]

It's where i learned about livin'
Its where i learned about love
It's where i learned about Jesus
And knowin' where i stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me
This is who I am
Give me a tin roof, a front porch, and a gravel road
And thats home to me, feels like home to me

[Chorus]

You get a line I'll get a pole
We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole
Five card poker on Satuday night
Church on Sunday morning
Make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
Say the things you used to say and make the world go away

Do you remember when you loved me before the world took me astray
If you do then forgive me and make the world go away

Make the world go away...

I'm sorry if I hurt you I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to and make the world go away

Make the world go away...
There'll be no strings to bind your hands
not if my love can't bind your heart.
And there's no need to take a stand
for it was I who chose to start.
I see no need to take me home,
I'm old enough to face the dawn.

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
then slowly turn away from me.

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
and it won't matter anyhow.
If morning's echo says we ve sinned,
well, it was what I wanted now.
And if we're victims of the night,
I won't be blinded by the light.

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
then slowly turn away,
I won't beg you to stay with me
through the tears of the day,
of the years, baby baby baby.

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me, darline
just call me angel of the morning, angel
just touch my cheek before you leave me, darline
Love me tender, love me sweet,
Never let me go.
You have made my life complete,
And I love you so.

Love me tender, love me true,
All my dreams fulfill.
For my darling, I love you,
And I always will.

Love me tender, love me long,
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

Love me tender, love me true,
All my dreams fulfill.
For my darling, I love you,
And I always will.

Love me tender, love me dear,
Tell me you are mine.
I'll be yours through all the years,
Till the end of time.

When at last my dreams come true,
Darling, this I know:
Happiness will follow you,
Everywhere you go.

Love me tender, love me true,
All my dreams fulfill.
For my darling, I love you,
And I always will.
No other lover ever really cared
When I've reached out for you you've always been there
Now I'm so far away and baby I'm scared
I never knew lonely 'til you.

You are my rock and the strength I need
To keep me sane in this life that I lead
Now I'm not with you and my broken heart bleeds
I never knew lonely 'til you.

Never knew lonely could be so blue
Never knew lonely could tear you in two
Never loved someone like I love you
I never knew lonely 'til you.

--- Instrumental ---

I can't make up for the times I've been gone
But I'll prove I love you in the words of this song
Back in your arms girl it's where I belong
I never knew lonely 'til you.

Never knew lonely could be so blue
Never knew lonely could tear you in two
Never loved someone like I love you
I never knew lonely 'til you.

Never loved someone like I love you
I never knew lonely 'til you...
Starin' out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart

Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should I try to grow up
But who knows where to start

So I just ...
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen 'em both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just tryin' to search my soul

From the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go

So I just ...
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me

So I'll just ...
Sit right here, have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

Down in Mexico ...
Maybe I just wanna touch you
Feel you warm inside again
Maybe I just wanna hurt you
The sweetest pleasure is pain
I don't know why why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why why
It just makes me feel alive.
Are you coming........to the moment
When you know your heart can break?
I'm inside you, I'm around you
I just wanna hear you cry again
I don't know why why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why why
It just makes me feel alive.
You don't know how much it hurts
When you fall asleep
In my arms
And if this dies before the morning comes
I wanna runaway, I wanna runaway
I don't know why why
But I love to see you cry
I don't know why why
It just make me feel alive.
I'll always remember,
the song they were playing,
The first time we danced and I knew

As we swayed to the music,
and held to each other,
I fell in love with you

Chorus:
Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life,
Could you be my partner
every night,
when we're together
it feels so right,
Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life

I'll always remember,
that magic moment,
When I held you close to me

As we move together,
I knew forever,
you're all I'll ever need

Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life,
Could you be my partner
every night,
when we're together
it feels so right,
Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life

Could I have this dance
for the rest of my life,
Could you be my partner
every night,
when we're together
it feels so right,
Could I have this dance
for the rest --of --my life!!
I'm finding out how hot an old flame can burn.
You're a feeling I haven't forgot, the love I can't unlearn.
You've become a memory I can't live without.
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

Chorus:
I don't know how to handle the dream you left behind.
It's like a lighted candle burning up my mind.
At least I'm happy knowing what love is all about.
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

Embers to ashes, that's how it should be.
You'd think by now my heart would know,
And it could set you free.
The things I've tried, the tears I've cried,
I guess there's no doubt
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

Chorus:
I don't know how to handle the dream you left behind.
It's like a lighted candle burning up my mind.
At least I'm happy knowing what love is all about.
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

You'll always be a fire I can't put out...
Well its sunday morning
And the sun is shining in my
Eye that is open
And my head is spinning
Was the life of the party
I can't stop grinning
I had too much tequllia last night

Jose Quervo
You are a friend of mine
I like to drink you with
A little salt and lime
Did I kiss all the cowboys
Did I shoot out the lights
Did I dance on the bar
Did I start any fights

Now wait a minute
Things don't look to familiar
Who is the cowboy whos sleeping beside me
Well he's awful cute
But how'd I get his shirt on
I had too much tequllia last night

All those little shooters
How I love to drink them down
Come on bartender lets have another round
Well the music is playing
And my spirits are high
Tomorrow might be painful
But tonight we're going to fly

Jose Quervo
You are a friend of mine

Everytime we get together

Jose Quervo
You are a friend of mine
He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
She said Daddy when you coming home?
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said, I really miss you darlin'
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be all right
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh I'm already there

We may be a
Thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you
Wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh I'm already there

Oh I'm already there

Theres joy everywhere

[Chorus]
Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonley just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve

I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle bear(?)

I look but all I see is

Why did you have to leave me

[Chorus]
The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in
I said, "I'm sorry but we're closed"
And she said "I know,
But I'm afraid I left my purse"
I said, "I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours"
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, "You'll only get this back on one condition"

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evenin'
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, "This is the last thing I expected"
And then she took me by the hand
And said, "I'll only marry you on one condition"

And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced
Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor
But the music played
We held each other close
And we danced
Yeah, we danced
Looking into your eyes I know I'm right
if there's anything worth my love it's worth a fight
we only get one chance
but nothing ties our hands

You're what I want
listen to me
nothing I want
is out of my reach

(chorus)
(I'M FREE)
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear
love's the only thing that keeps me here
(I'M FREE)
you're the reason that I'm hanging on
my heart's staying where my heart belongs
(I'M FREE)

Running away will never make me free
and nothing we sign is any kind of guarantee

But I wanna hold you now
and I won't hold you down

I'm shaking the past
making my breaks
taking control
if that's what it takes

(chorus)

But I wanna hold you now
and I won't hold you down

You're what I want
listen to me
nothing I want
is out of my reach

(chorus x 3)

unrecorded last verse (from KPFA, ~1993)

When I get home to my Ma and Pa,
I know they're gonna lay down the law.
About the honky tonk blues,
Them jumpin' honkty tonk blues.
Lord I'm suffrin' with the honky tonk blues.
By the time I get to Phoenix,
She'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh, when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
Cause I've left that girl, so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch,
and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry, just to think, I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know,
I would really go
Every friday night there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pick-up trucks
Got old Hank crankin way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down
There's a big fire burnin but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls gettin down on the farm

Ed's been on the tractor ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen em headed down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughter's just pulled up in a Jeep
Man he knows how to grow em if you know what i mean
Old Dave's gettin loud but he don't mean harm
We're just country boys and girls gettin down on the farm

Chorus:
You can have a lotta fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin down on the farm

You can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know:
Don't mess with the bull cause he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate, stay outta the beans
If it starts to rain then we'll just head to the barn
We're country boys and girls gettin down on the farm

Chorus

Let's get down y'all

Stay outta that hay
Conway Twitty &amp; Loretta Lynn

People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself, I can't decieve
I know it's only make believe.

My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you.

No one will ever know
How much, I love you so
My only prayer will be
Is someday you'll care for me.

But it's only make believe.

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything.

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me.

But it's only make believe.

My one and only prayer
Is that someday you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you.

No one will ever know
How much, I love you so
My prayers, my hopes and my schemes
You are my every dream.

But it's only make believe...

(make believe)...
I woke up cryin' late at night - when I was very young
I had dreamed my father - had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him - I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down the mirrowed hall and tapped upon his door.

And I said, "Daddy, I'm so afraid!
How would I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore
So may I stay with you?"

And he said,
"That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me ...
That's my job, you see."

Later we barely got along - this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems - were over different dreams
We each held for me ...
He wanted knowledge and learning - I wanted to fly out west
"Said I could make it out there - if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?"

And I said, "Daddy, I'm so afraid
Theres no guarentee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?"

And he said,
"That's my job, that's what I do
Ev'rything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me ...
That's my job, you see."

Every person carves his spot - and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might - light as bright as he.

Woke up early one bright fall day - read the tragic news
After all my travels, I settled down - within a mile or two
I make my livin' with words and rhymes - and all the tragedies
Should go into my head and out instead - as bits of poetry.

But I say, "Daddy I'm so afraid
How will I go on - with you gone this way
How can I come up - with a song to say, "I love you."

"That's my job, that's what I do
Ev'rything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me ...
That's my job, you see."

"Ev'rything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me."
I'm having day dreams bout night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having day dreams about night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And every night you make my daydreams come true

Well all day long while I'm working in town
Time slows down to a crawl
When I'm not thinking about you I'm checking the clock on the wall
Then it's goodbye factory and hello loving
There's a smile across my face
Cause I'm back in the arms of your sweet love
Where my thoughts have been all day

I'm having day dreams bout night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And while my hands make a living my mind's home loving you
I'm having day dreams about night things
In the middle of the after-noon
And every night you make my daydreams come true

Yea, Every night you make my day dreams come true.
Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss,
I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Everytime I call my baby, to try to get a date
My boss says,
No dice, son, you gotta work late
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom 'n' papa told me, "Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Now you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nation
Well I called my congressman and he said quote
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Yeah, sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
No there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Ah, paint it green boy

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene"
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.

Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, cat, go.

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes.

Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name
All over the place.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

You can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor
From an old fruitjar.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just the telephone
Papa called mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were all right
Mama would wait for that call to come in
But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again

Chorus

Momma was a looker
Lord how she shined
Papa was a good'n
But the jealous kind
Papa Loved Mama
Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard
Papa's in the pen

Well, it was bound to happen
One night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin to surprise her he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for mama up and down the hall
Then I heard the bottle break against the bedroom wall
That ol' Diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town.

Well, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes, and he was shifting gears.

Chorus
A walk in the park
I've got to get some sense back into my head
I'm in the dark and I can't see where I am being led
I'd give the world to set the clock back and act like a man
Where can I turn to save myself from this confusion

A walk in the park, a step in the dark
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today

A walk in the park
Away from all the busy streets of my mind
I seek a straighter path
I seek a shady glade in which to unwind
But why do we go on in spite of mistakes, in spite of destruction
Life can be fun depending on your situation.

A walk in the park, a step in the dark
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today

[Guitar solo]

A walk in the park, a step in the dark
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today
Wild Angels


(Gary Harrison/Harry Stinson)

Between the perfect world and the bottom line
Keeping love alive in these troubled times
It's a miracle in itself
And we know too well what that's about
Still we made it through, only God knows how
We must've had a little help
(Must've been)

Chorus:
Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Watching over you and me
Wild Angels, Wild Angels
Baby what else could it be

Well it must've been hard, it must've been tough
Keeping up with crazy fools like us
'Cause it's so easy to fall apart
And we still break each other's heart sometimes
Spent some nights on the jagged side
Somehow we wake up in each other's arms
(Must've been)

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
There are some nights
I watch you while you dream
I swear I hear the sound of beating wings

[ with Buck Owens ]

I came here looking for something
I couldn't find anywhere else
Hey I'm not tryin' to be nobody
just want a chance to be myself
I've spent a thousand miles of thumbin'
yes I've worn blisters on my heels
Tryin' to find me something better
here on the streets of Bakersfield

Hey you don't know me but you don't like me
say you care less how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me
ever walked the streets of Bakerfield
[ guitar - accordion ]
Spent some time in San Francisco
I spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man
Left him my watch and my old house key
don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as I was leaving
and I headed out for Bakersfield

Hey you don't know me...
Hey you don't know me...
How many of you that sit and judge me
ever walked the streets of Bakerfield
I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories I don't need'em
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we got nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah

And you're gonna think of me
Oh someday baby, someday
If there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope you're on it
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
Cause I swear out there ain't where you ought to be
So, catch a ride, catch a cab
Don't you know I miss you bad
But don't you walk to me

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

If you ain't got a suitcase get a box or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck, take a chevy
Baby just come back
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why don't you take it
Don't let that speed limit slow ya down
Go on and break it

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue skies
Straight in a straight line
You can't get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run...Baby run...Oh baby run...
Whoa, I need a man to love me.
Don't you understand me, baby ?
Why, I need a man to love.
I gotta find him, I gotta have him like the air I breathe.
One lovin' man to understand can't be too much to need.

You know it

Baby, surrounding me.

No, no, know it just can't be
No it just can't be
There's got to be some kind of answer.
No it just can't be
And everywhere I look, there's none around
No it just can't be
Whoa, it can't be
No it just can't be, oh no!
Whoa, hear me now.

Whoa, won't you let me hold you ?
Honey, just close your eyes.
Whoa, won't you let me hold you, dear ?
I want to just put my arms around ya, like the circles going 'round the sun.
And-a let me hold you daddy, at least until the morning comes.

Because it

No it just can't be
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, just can't be.
No, no, no
No it just can't be

And why can't anyone ever tell me, now ?
No it just can't be
I wake up one morning, I realize
No it just can't be
Whoa, it can't be.
No it just can't be
Now go!

Whoa, I need a man to love me
Oh, maybe you can help me, please.
Why, I need a man to love.
But I believe that someday and somehow it's bound to come along
Because when all my dreams and all my plans just cannot turn out wrong.

You know it
Can't be now Oh no
Can't be now Oh no
Can't be now Oh no

And who could be foolin' me ?
No it just can't be
I've got all this hurt inside
No it just can't be
Come, come, come on, come on, come on, and help me now.
No it just can't be
Please, can't you hear my cry ?
No it just can't be
Whoa, help ...
Well I was raised on country classics
Like Roy Acuff and George Jones
Lord I loved to hear 'em
Sing all them old time country songs
But I really got excited 'bout the time I turned 15
That's the first time I heard Waylon and old Bocephus sing
They put some drive in their country that really turned me on

Yeah, put some drive in your country
Keep country drivin' on
When the music gets you movin'
You know that can't be wrong
Every time I hear that outlaw stuff on my car radio
It makes me wanna drive it just as fast as it will go
Put some drive in your country
Let's keep country drivin' on

We played some shows in Atlanta on Sunday afternoons
The gigs were packed and I was nervous
Cause I wanted folks to like my tunes
The crowds were full of younger people
They were all about my age
So I turned and told the band just before we walked on stage
Put some drive in your country fellas
We turned those people on

Yeah, put some drive in your country
Keep country drivin' on
When the music gets you dancin'
You know that can't be wrong
See I made myself a promise when I was just a kid
I'd mix southern rock and country and that's just what I did
Put some drive in your country
Keep country drivin' on

Put some drive in your country
Hey, let's keep country drivin' on
When the music gets you movin'
You know that can't be wrong
I still love old country
I ain't tryin' to put it down
Damn I miss Duanne Allman
I wish he was still around
Put some drive in the country
Keep country drivin' on

Put some drive in the country
Let's keep country drivin' on
In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain.

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In the land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain.
Instrumental
To change the world, start with one step
However small, the first step is hardest of all
Once you get your gait, you'll be walkin' tall
You said you never did, cuz you might die tryin'
Cuz you might die tryin', cuz you...

If you close your eyes cuz the house is on fire
And think you couldn't move until fire dies
The things you never did, oh, cuz you might die tryin'
Cuz you might die tryin', you'd be as good as dead
Cuz you might die tryin', cuz you might die tryin'

(sax solo) I still remember I woke up and all ran away

If you give, you begin to live
If you give, you begin to live
You begin, you get the world
If you give, you begin to live
You get the world, you get the world
If you give,YOU BEGIN TO LIVE, YOU MIGHT DIE TRYIN'
Oh you might die tryin', you might die tryin'
The things you never did, oh cuz you might die tryin'
You'd be as good as dead
The things you never did

come to find out she lives right next door to me
I don't know what I'm gonna do
This is tough on me
I just gotta
I just gotta talk to somebosy

Hey fellows, gather round
Let me tell you bout a girl
Who's blowin' my mind
She's really new in town
Fresh and lovely
And ever so fine
I said, "How do you do?
There's never been another girl like you
My heart just skips a beat
Whenever you're near to me"
She let me walk with her
I thought it couldn't get any better
But there was even more
I found out she's the girl next door
I want to be with her forevermore
The girl next door, yeah
I need to be with her

Now since I've been with her
I found my whole world
is furnin around
She never rocks the boat
Yes she keeps it
From runnin' aground
Sometimes I can't believe
That she only wants to be with me
It seems like such a crime
Not to share such a lovely find
I never get too much
I'm livin' every moment for her touch
(But I get all I need)
Because she lives next door
(Girl next door) Next to me (Scat) baby
(Girl next door) The girl next door
(Girl next door) (Scat)
I wanna be be be be with you
(Girl next door) Together yeah
Hey yeah yeah, now tell me, baby
(Girl next door)

What could she have in store
The girl next door
Her very essence, her presence
I do adore
And bein' this close
Is drivin' me wild
I love her personality
Her style, her smile
My life is bright
Once more again
Our lives are hot
Our souls will blend
I love that girl
More than all the world
She's like priceless diamonds
Curltured pearls
She took me by surprise
Right before my eyes
She came to me
Like a vision on earth
I didn't have to lock
I didn't have to search
I'll never bore
My girl next door
Each other's body
We'll explore
Our love will grow
Forevermore

Girl next door, she caught me peekin'
Oh, you naughty boy!
Girl next door
Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman

And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

Honey, take your time, cause I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman
I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
Sittin' in a restaraunt and she walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said who's that you said with a smile
Oh it's nobody, aww nobody
Maybe that explains the last two weeks
You call me up dead on your feet
Working late again I ask who with
You said nobody, aww nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever (clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive
You were miles away
I ask who's on your mind
You said nobody (nobody) why do you ask
Oh her again, I couldve told you that
We came back home got ready for bed
I said to myself I've got one shot left
Your still mine
And I won't stand in line behind nobody, aww nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think shes being clever (clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

(Repeat)
Midnight,
and I'm a-waiting
on the twelve-oh-five
Hoping it'll take me
just a little farther down the line

Moonlight,
you're just a heartache in disguise;
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
if it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie,
thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody
what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie,
thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just
what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
when you say you're only in it for fun
Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie,
thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Playing with the queen of hearts

(repeat and fade)
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

(Chorus)

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

(Repeat Chorus)

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

(Repeat Chorus)

Love and only love
Love and only love
We were born in this little town
Growin' up I was countin' down
Every single day till we made our get-away
But you said you could never see yourself
Trying to make a life anywhere else
This would be your home
And I was on my own
But ever since you said good-bye
I've been out here on the wind
And baby you would be surprised
All the places you have been

I've seen you in Albuquerque waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey
Girl I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia pickin' them peaches
Carolina barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you
Everywhere

Now a days when I'm passin' through
The conversation always turns to you
I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line
Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids and the kind of life
That you want to lead
Guess you could say the same for me
But you and I made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road
Maybe in

Oklahoma drivin' 'cross the prairie
In Dallas Texas isn't that where we
Always said we would like to try
But never did so maybe that's why
You're on every highway just beyond the high-beams
Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you
In..

Albuquerque waitin' out a blizzard
Arizona dancin' 'cross the desert
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey
Girl I swear just the other day you were
Down in Georgia pickin' them peaches
In Carolina barefoot on the beaches
No matter where you choose to be
In my heart I'll always see you
Everywhere
(I dont wanna spend another lonely night oooh)
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked, the bedroom TV's on
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave (never leave)
'Cause if you're getting on with your new life.
Then where does that leave me

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
Hoping that I didn't wait too long
(I didn't wait too long)
That this is just the dark before the dawn

Deep in my heart I know
That you love me as much as I love you ( you know i love you girl)
And that you must be lying somewhere
Looking up to Heaven too

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night ( dont make me speand another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
I don't want to spend another lonely night
I don't want to spend another lonely night
(Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight
I don't want to spend another lonely night
Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo
Prayin' for daylight
Changin' lanes and talkin' on the phone
Drivin' way too fast
The interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of comin' in last
But somewhere in the race we run
We're comin' undone.

Days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
Cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by.

I was on the roof just the other night
And watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights and runnin' through the river
Of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
We're losin' ourselves.

Days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
Cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by.

We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
We talk about forever but we've only got today.

Days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window as the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you'd better start livin'
We'd better start livin'
We'd better start livin' right now.

Days go by
I can feel them flyin'
Like a hand out the window in the wind
Cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start livin' right now
'Cause days go by.

'Cause days go by
Oh, so take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let them all fly by
Come on
Come on now
Don't you know the days go by...
I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
on a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red
rhine county watermelon festival ahead

well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
took a two lane road to a one horse town
there was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

chourus:
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
help yourself to some, but obey the law if you drink
don't drive do the watermelon crawl

when the band started playin the watermelon queen
said let me show you somethin' that you ain't ever seen
she grabbed me by the arm said come on lets go
she dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed

she rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
she craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
she wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
she said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

chourus

if your ever down in georgia around about july
if you ain't in a hurry then you aw to stop by
i can guarantee that you're goin have a ball
learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl

chourus

yeah do the watermelon crawl
have fun you all
do the watermelon crawl
I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely

Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now, so far away

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay?

Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes now so fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today

So there it is, girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?

I know it's late and I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely , both of us lonely

We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light, come take my hand now
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
I've been down the Mississippi,
Down through New Orleans,
Yes, I have.
I've played in California,
There ain't too much I haven't seen.
No, there ain't.
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man.
Left a girl in West Virginia,
Up there where that green grass grows,
Yes, I did.
Another girl in Cincinnati,
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows,
Poor girl!
I'm a ramblin' man,
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man.

You'd better move away,
You're standin' too close to the flame.
Once I mess with your mind,
Your little heart won't beat the same.
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man,
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.
Better not!

Well, up in Chicago,
I was known as "Quiet Boy,"
Yes, I was!
Down in Alabama,
They call me "The man of joy,"
Still do!
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man.

You'd better move away,
You're standin' too close to the flame.
Once I mess with your mind,
Your little heart won't beat the same.
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man,
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.
Skippin' rocks, skippin' rope
Laughin' at all my best friends jokes
Things I loved when I was a kid
Muddy roads, muddy feet
I didn't live on no blacktop street
Things have changed a lot but I never did

And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

Livin' right, livin' in this little old town I grew up in
But I still held on to my dreams
Standin' proud, standin' tall
Standin' smack dab in the middle of it all
I don't worry about things that I can't change

And I don't wanna think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

And everything around me are things I dearly love
And every night I get on my knees and thank
The Lord above

That I don't have to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die

I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just wanna live until I die
I cant remember when you werent there
When I didnt care for anyone but you
I swear weve been through everything there is
Cant imagine anything weve missed
Cant imagine anything the two of us cant do

Through the year, youve never let me down
You turned my life around, the sweetest days Ive found
Ive found with you ... through the years
Ive never been afraid, Ive loved the life weve made
And Im so glad Ive stayed, right here with you
Through the years

I cant remember what I used to do
Who I trusted whom, I listened to before
I swear youve taught me everything I know
Cant imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more

Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, Ive always been so glad
To be with you ... through the years
Its better everyday, youve kissed my tears away
As long as its okay, Ill stay with you
Through the years

Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you ... through the years
I never had a doubt, wed always work things out
Ive learned what loves about, by loving you
Through the years

Through the years, youve never let me down
Youve turned my life around, the sweetest days Ive found
Ive found with you ... through the years
Its better everyday, youve kissed my tears away
As long as its okay, Ill stay with you
Through the years!
When the train rolls by
I'm gonna be ready this time
When the boy gets that look in his eye
I'm gonna be ready this time
When my momma said I look good in white
I'm gonna be ready this time


Oh yeah...
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?


I feel the wind blow through my hair
I'm gonna be ready this time
I'll buy a ticket to anywhere
I'm gonna be ready this time
You see, it feels like I'm starting to care
(And) I'm gonna be ready this time (ready this time)


Oh yeah...
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?


Ready To Run
Ready To Run

Oh...
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love?


Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
Im Ready To Run

I'm ready
Oh, I'm ready to run
I'm ready
Ready To Run
Ready To Run
I hope that the days come easy and the moments pass slow,
And each road leads you where you want to go,
And if you're faced with a choice, and you have to choose,
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you.
And if one door opens to another door closed,
I hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window,
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile,

But more than anything, more than anything,
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to,
Your dreams stay big, and your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more than you can hold,
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too,
Yeah, this, is my wish.

I hope you never look back, but ya never forget,
All the ones who love you, in the place you left,
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret,
And you help somebody every chance you get,
Oh, you find God's grace, in every mistake,
And you always give more than you take.

But more than anything, yeah, and more than anything,
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to,
Your dreams stay big, and your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more than you can hold,
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too,
Yeah, this, is my wish.

This is my wish
I hope you know somebody loves you
May all your dreams stay big
It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My thing done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand L. Boogie's non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for me gun
Can't take a threat to me newborn son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless now I'm on Hope road
Every man wants to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgement
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it's time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come
When it's all done did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come
You just lost one
Now don't you understand man universal law
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come
When it's all done did you really gain from

Yeah, that's a big 10-4 there, Pig Pen, yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy. Mercy sakes alive, looks like we got us a convoy...

Was the dark of the moon on the sixth of June
In a Kenworth pullin' logs
Cab-over Pete with a reefer on
And a Jimmy haulin' hogs
We is headin' for bear on I-one-oh
'Bout a mile outta Shaky Town
I says, "Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck."
"And I'm about to put the hammer down."

[Chorus]
'Cause we got a little convoy
Rockin' through the night.
Yeah, we got a little convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way.
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the U-S-A.
Convoy!


[On the CB]
Ah, breaker, Pig Pen, this here's the Duck. And, you wanna back off them hogs? Yeah, 10-4, 'bout five mile or so. Ten, roger. Them hogs is gettin' in-tense up here.

By the time we got into Tulsa Town,
We had eighty-five trucks in all.
But they's a roadblock up on the cloverleaf,
And them bears was wall-to-wall.
Yeah, them smokies is thick as bugs on a bumper;
They even had a bear in the air!
I says, "Callin' all trucks, this here's the Duck."
"We about to go a-huntin' bear."

[Chorus]
'Cause we got a great big convoy
Rockin' through the night.
Yeah, we got a great big convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way.
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy

[On the CB]
Ah, you wanna give me a 10-9 on that, Pig Pen? Negatory, Pig Pen; you're still too close. Yeah, them hogs is startin' to close up my sinuses. Mercy sakes, you better back off another ten.

Well, we rolled up Interstate 44
Like a rocket sled on rails.
We tore up all of our swindle sheets,
And left 'em settin' on the scales.
By the time we hit that Chi-town,
Them bears was a-gettin' smart:
They'd brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinoise National Guard.
There's armored cars, and tanks, and jeeps,
And rigs of ev'ry size.
Yeah, them chicken coops was full'a bears
And choppers filled the skies.
Well, we shot the line and we went for broke
With a thousand screamin' trucks
An' eleven long-haired Friends a' Jesus
In a chartreuse micra-bus.


[On the CB]
Ah, Rubber Duck to Sodbuster, come over. Yeah, 10-4, Sodbuster? Lissen, you wanna put that micra-bus right behind that suicide jockey? Yeah, he's haulin' dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get.

Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey shore
And prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a dog-goned dime.
I says, "Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck.
"We just ain't a-gonna pay no toll."
So we crashed the gate doing ninety-eight
I says "Let them truckers roll, 10-4."

[Chorus]
'Cause we got a mighty convoy
Rockin' through the night.
Yeah, we got a mighty convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way.
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the U-S-A.


Convoy! Ah, 10-4, Pig Pen, what's your twenty?
Convoy! OMAHA? Well, they oughta know what to do with them hogs out there fer shure. Well, mercy
Convoy! sakes, good buddy, we gonna back on outta here, so keep the bugs off your glass and the bears off your...
Convoy! tail. We'll catch you on the flip-flop. This here's the Rubber Duck on the side.
Convoy! We gone. 'Bye,'bye.
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously,
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening,
In a conversation,
Bout the way things use to be.

I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door,
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor,
Hanging onto every word,
man the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days,
Five miles to school uphill both ways,
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor,
Course that was back before the war,
Yea your uncle and I made quit a pair,
Flying F-15's through hostile air,
He went down but they missed me by a hair,
He'd always stop right there and say,

That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
as your chins held high as the tears fall down,
gut sucked in, chest stuck out,
Like a small town flag a flying,
Or a new born baby crying,
In the arms of the woman that you love,
That's something to be proud of,

Son graduatin college, that was momma's dream,
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen,
that's when you got a fast car, and think you got everything,

I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith,
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A.
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage,

I fell in love next thing I know,
Babies came and the car got sold,
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod,
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs,
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down,
If you're ashamed how I turned out,
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow,
Said let me tell you right now

That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working,
If you're doing what you're able,
Putting food there on the table,
And providing for the family that you love,
That's something to be proud of

And if all you ever really do is the best you can,
Well you did it man,

That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
As your chins held high as the tears fall down,
gut sucked in, chest stuck out,
Like a small town flag a flying,
Or a new born baby crying,
In the arms of the woman that you love,
That's something to be proud of,
That's something to be proud of,
That's something to be proud of,
That's something to be proud of,
Now that's something to be proud of

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip
To Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)

Big Bad John

(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much he's kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all you just said "hi" to Big John
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a cajun queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John

(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed
Their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke
Of this man made hell walked a giant of a man
That the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree just stood there alone
Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)

Big Bad John

(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out
"There's a light up above"
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave
And now there's only one left down there to save
Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line
For Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)

Big Bad John

(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand

"At the bottom of this mine lies one hell of a man...

Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

Chorus:
You load sixteen tons, and whattaya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don'cha call me, cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number-nine coal
And the straw boss said, "Well bless my soul!"

Chorus

I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebreak by an old mama lion
Cain't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

Chorus

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

Chorus
she caught me on the back porch once again
in the middle of a fight we both Knew i couldn't win.
then she came up from behind and took my glass
and she said hold me instead and soon the urge will pass
and then she whispered I'm forever by your side
and together we can beat this thing one step at a time

(chorus) then she kissed me mmm and it moved me
yea she took away the fear and pain and
gave someting new to sooth me
she said she needs me
oh and she loves me
and with a woman as strong as that
yea who needs the whiskey?

well i kept my weakness hidden for so long
oh but she gave me the stregnth to admit that I'd been wrong
and when I asked her why she stood right by my side,
she said you'd do the same for me
with tears in her eyes then she wrapped her arms around me
and held me close and said if you ever need
something stronger baby just let me know

Chorus
yes she said she loves me and she'd never leave me
and with a woman as strong as that yea
with a woman as strong as that well who needs the whiskey?
i'm free yea who needs the whiskey??
Pop a top again
I just got time for one more round
Sit em up my friends
Then I'll be gone
Then you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you'd to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I'd tried to smile and did a while it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tears drops streamming down his face.

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Sit em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down.

Home for me is misery and here I am wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me it's not what I perfer
So it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her.

Pop a top again
I think I'll have another round
Sit em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
Pop a top again.
The car won’t start - it’s falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My panty line shows - got a run in my hose
My hair went flat - man, I hate that (hate that)

Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress - I must confess
This could be worse than PMS

This job ain’t worth the pay
Can’t wait til the end of the day
Honey, I’m on my way
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Honey, I’m home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I’m back, my head’s killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone - give the dog a bone
Hey! Hey! Honey, I’m home!

I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud ‘cause it hurt like hell
This job’s a pain - it’s so mundane
It sure don’t stimulate my brain

(verse one)
She's been going out with him
She's been going out with me
Said she'd let us know by tonight which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was going on
So I drove by her house, and sure enough...
(Chorus)
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl, my whole world
But that ain't my truck
(verse two)
I pulled over by the curb
I've been sitting here all night
Wondering what it was I did so wrong that he did so right
I thought of breaking down the door
But there's nothing left to say
That Chevy 4x4 says it all
Sitting in my place
(Chorus)
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord, this don't look good at all
That's my girl
My whole world
But that ain't my truck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all

My whole world
But that ain't my truck
That's my girl
My whole world

That's my girl....my whole world...(repeat to fade)
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your cowboy boots and your painted on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that

Here comes my baby dragging my heart behind
He's driving me crazy who says love is blind
He's got a wandering eye and a traveling mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine

Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that

I just can't stand it to see him on the town
He's out slow dancing with every girl around
I'm a softhearted woman he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine

Why'd you come in here lookin' like that...

Why'd you come in here lookin' like that...
I’m waitin’ on the sun to set cause yesterday aint over yet
I started smoking cigaretts there’s nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads aint made for walking, spinning tires aint made for stoppin’
I’m giving up on love cause love’s given up on me

I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life aint hard but it’s too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheating really aint a crime
I’m giving up on love cause love’s given up on me

Forget you high society, I’m soakin’ it in Kerosene
Light ‘em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn HA!
Dirty hands aint made for shakin’, aint a rule that aint worth breakin’
Well I’m giving up on love cause love’s given up on me

Now I don’t hate the one who left, You can't hate someone who's dead
He’s out there holding on to someone, I’m holding up my smoking gun
I’ll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well I’m giving up on love cause love’s given up on me
Well I’m giving up on love HEY love’s given up on me

I lost her trail on a Friday night
She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go

It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Askin' bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

And I know she'll be coming back
Her car is waiting right outside
But, I don't want to think about
Who's taking her for a ride
And her unpredictability
Is what I love about her best

Lord I've got to find her quick
Before she does something I regret

It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Askin' bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

She's out there somewhere
Burnin up the night
Somehow I've got to run her down
I'm running out of time

It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Askin' bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only come a town about twice a year
He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
It's before my time but I've been told
He never come back from Copperhead Road

Grandaddy ran whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound
When the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first,'round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
Now the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from Charlie don't you know
You better stay away from Copperhead Road

It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
Now I just cant believe youre in my life
Heavens smilin down on me
As I look at you tonight

I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doin
When he joined these two hearts
I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
Ive got all Ill ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

Soft moonlight on your face oh how you shine
It takes my breath away
Just to look into your eyes
I know I dont deserve a treasure like you
There really are no words
To show my gratitude

So I tip my hat to the keeper of the stars
He sure knew what he was doin
When he joined these two hearts
I hold everything
When I hold you in my arms
Ive got all Ill ever need
Thanks to the keeper of the stars

It was no accident me finding you
Someone had a hand in it
Long before we ever knew
One word, that's all you said,
Something in your voice caused me to turn my head.
Your smile just captured me, you were in my future as far as i could see.
And i dont know how it happened, but it happens still.
You ask me if i love you, if i always will....

Well, you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow the moment that i looked into your eyes,
You won me, it was over from the start.
You completely stole my heart, and now you won't let go.
I never even had a chance you know?
You had me from hello

Inside i built a wall, so high around my heart, i thought i'd never fall.
One touch, you brought it down
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And i swore to me that i wasn't going to love again
The last time was the last time i'd let someone in

But, you had me from hello
I felt love start to grow the moment that i looked into your eyes,
You won me, it was over from the start.
You completely stole my heart, and now you wont let go.
I never even had a chance you know?
You had me from hello

Thats all you said
Something in your voice caused me to turn my head
You had me from hello
You had me from hello
Girl, i've loved you from hello

with nowhere to go and no pot of gold in sight
All my wishes were just way too much to hope for,
But when I saw you, I knew I'd seen the light

And not a moment too soon, Without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour
with my world filled with blues
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon

I used to think that love would never find me
And the one who cares was lost somewhere in time
But when you found me I knew I'd found forever,
You rescued me just before I crossed the line

And not a moment too soon, Without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour

Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Oh not a moment too soon, yeah

Oh I try to speak but the words won't come

I feel so helpless; I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

Whenever you come around
It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his suprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
Well she's all you'd ever want
She's the kind I'd like to flaunt and take to dinner
Well she always knows her place
She's got style, she's got grace, she's a winner.

She's a Lady. Whoa whoa whoa, she's a Lady
Talkin' about that little Lady, and the Lady is mine.

Well she's never in the way
Always something nice to say, Oh what a blessing.
I can leave her on her own
Knowing she's okay alone, and there's no messing.

She's a Lady. Whoa whoa whoa, she's a Lady
Talkin' about that little Lady, and the Lady is mine.

Well she never asks for very much and I don't refuse her
Always treat her with respect, I never would abuse her.
What she's got is hard to find, and I don't want to lose her.
Help me build a mountain from my little pile of clay. Hey, hey, hey

Well she knows what I'm about,
She can take what I dish out, and that's not easy.
Well she knows me through and through,
She knows just what to do, and how to please me.

She's a Lady. Whoa whoa whoa, she's a Lady
Talkin' about that little Lady, and the Lady is mine.

Yeah yeah yeah, She's a Lady
Listen to me baby, She's a Lady

And the Lady is mine

Talkin' about this little Lady
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
And the Lady is mine

Yeah yeah, She's a Lady
And the Lady is mine.
He walked up to the bar and parked his lanky frame upon a tall bar stool,
And with a long soft southern drawl said,
I'll just have a glass of anything that's cool;
A barroom girl with hard and knowing eyes slowly looked him up and down,
And she thought I wonder how on earth
That country bumpkin found his way to town.

She said. "Hello country bumpkin, how's the frost down on the pumpkin?
I've seen some sights, but man you're somethin',
Where'd you come from country bumpkin?"

It was just a short year later in a bed
Of joy-filled tears, yet death-like pain,
Into this wondrous world of many wonders
One more wonder came;
That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness,
As she marvelled at the soft and warm,
And cuddly boy child feeding at her breast.

And she said,"Hello country bumpkin,
Fresh as frost down on the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights, but babe you're somethin',
Mama loves her country bumpkin"

Forty years of hard work later in a simple, quiet
And peaceful country place,
The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face;
She was lying on her death-bed knowing fully well
Her race was nearly run,
But she softly smiled and looked into
The sad eyes of her husband and her son.

And she said,"So long country bumpkin
The frost is gone now from the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'
See you later country bumpkin.

Michael: When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It.
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit.

When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing!

CHORUS:
Stop! The love you save may be your own!

Second verse:
Michael: Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benjie held your hand he felt
E-lec-tri-ci-tee!
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chimes.
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your times!


CHORUS:
Stop! The love you save may be your own!

Darling(fades)
She likes adventure with security
And more than one man can provide
She planned adventure feeling sure that he
Would not be home 'til after five
He turned on the lights and turned them off again,
And said the one thing he could say

All these years
Where have I been
I've been down the road to work and home again
And I'm still here
Until I'm gone
And don't you rub it in too hard that I've been wrong
All these years

She said, "You're not the man you used to be"
And He said, "Neither is this guy"
She said, "There's some things you refuse to see...
But I guess sometimes so do I"
She made no excuse why she was lying there,
She said the one thing she could say

All these years
What have I done?
I made your supper and your daughter and your son
Still I'm here,
And still confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years...

I'm still here
And so confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose,
All these years.
Well, I was raised in a sophisticated kind of style.
Yeah, my taste in music and women drove my folks half wild.
Mom and Dad had a plan for me,
It was debutantes and er-symphonies,
But I like my music hot; I like my women wild.

Yeah, an' I like my women just a little on the trashy side,
When they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed.
Too much lipstick an' er too much rouge,
Gets me excited, leaves me feeling confused.
An' I like my women just a little on the trashy side.

Shoulda seen the looks on the faces of my Dad and Mom,
When I showed up at the door with a date for the senior prom.
They said: &amp;amp;quot;Well, pardon us son, she ain't no kid.
&amp;amp;quot;That's a cocktail waitress in a Dolly Parton wig.
I said: &amp;amp;quot;I know it dad, ain't she cool, that's the kind I dig.&amp;amp;quot;

Yeah, an' I like my women just a little on the trashy side,
When they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed.
Too much lipstick an' er too much rouge,
Gets me excited, leaves me feeling confused.
An' I like my women just a little on the trashy side.

Instrumental break.

I like 'em sweet, I like 'em with a heart of gold.
Yeah an' I like 'em brassy, I like 'em brazen and bold.
Well, they say that opposites attract, well, I don't agree
I want a woman just as tacky as me.
Yeah, I like my women just a little on the trashy side.

Yeah, an' I like my women just a little on the trashy side,
When they wear their clothes too tight and their hair is dyed.
Too much lipstick an' er too much rouge,
Gets me excited, leaves me feeling confused.
An' I like my women just a little on the trashy side.

Yeah, I like my women an' I like 'em on the trashy side.
Well, these Highway Forty blues,
I've walked holes in both my shoes.
Counted the days since I've been gone,
And I'd love to see the lights of home.

Wasted time and money too;
Squandered youth in search of truth.
But in the end I had to lose,
Lord above, I've paid my dues.
Got the Highway Forty blues.

The highway called when I was young,
Told me lies of things to come.
Fame and fortune lies ahead!
That's what the billboard lights had said.

Shattered dreams, my mind is numb,
My money's gone, stick out my thumb.
My eyes are filled with bitter tears,
Lord, I ain't been home in years.
Got the Highway Forty blues.

--- Instrumental ---

You know, I've rambled all around,
Like a rolling stone, from town to town.
Met pretty girls I have to say,
But none of them could make me stay.

Well, I've played the music halls and bars,
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars:
Things a country boy can't use,
Dixieland I sure miss you.
Got the Highway Forty blues...
if these walls came crumbling down
and fell so hard to make us lose our faith
from what’s left you’d figure it out
and still make lemonade taste like a sunny day

stay beautiful, baby
I hope you stay American, baby
American baby

nobody’s laughing now
God's grace lost and the devil is proud
but I’ve been walking for a thousand miles
one last time I could see you smile

I, I, hold, hold on to you
you bring me hope I’ll see you soon,
and if I don’t see you
I’m afraid we’ve lost the way

stay beautiful, baby
I hope you stay American, baby
American baby
American baby

(that's the way) I hold on to you,
you lift me up and always will
I see you in light
hope I don’t get left behind

I, I, hold, hold on to you,
you bring me hope I’ll see you soon
and if I don’t see you
I’m afraid we’ve lost the way

stay beautiful, baby
I hope you stay American, baby
I hope you stay beautiful, baby
I hope you stay American, baby
American baby
American baby

Stay American, baby
beautiful

nobody’s laughing now
'cause you could always make me laugh out loud

stay American, baby
American baby
stay American, baby
American baby
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love....Love won't give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love....Love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
Every tear that I've cried....Only washed away the fear inside
Now I, I ain't gone 'n' give up on love

Every beat of my heart....Pounds with joy and not with pain
Every beat of my heart....Pounds with joy and not in vain
And although those are painful memories....Only brought me to my knees
I was just given up on love

Little Johnny Taylor told us so long ago
What about the midnight cryin'....Wo that cheatin' and lyin'
What about the price that will....Oh surely be paid
Those that gave up on love....Love will have it's day
I ain't givin' up on love

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love....Love won't give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love....Love won't give up on me
Every time I cry....Love just won't let me be....Won't set me free
If I had to live my life without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long
With you I see forever.. oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong
Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothings gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more then your love
Nothings gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life thru but
Nothings gonna change my love for you

If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star
I'll be there for you
If you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are
So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

Nothings gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothings gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
he world may change my whole life thru but
Nothings gonna change my love for you
She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will

There's a baby crying and one more on the way
There's a wolf at the door with a big stack of bills
They can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side

Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will

She's eighty-three and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the key to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it, love says they will
I took my love
And I took it down
I climbed a mountain
And I turned around
And I saw my reflection
in a snow covered hill
Well the Landslide brought me down

Oh mirror in the sky what is love
Can a child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh ah ... uh ah .... uh ah ...
uh ah ... uh ah ....uh ah....

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
Well...

(Instrumental)

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I build my life around you
But time makes bolder
Well Children get older
I'm getting older too

Well, I'm getting older too

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a Mountain and ya turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills

Well maybe... Well maybe... Well maybe

Landslide will bring you down.
She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate
Take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

[Chorus]
And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause its Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

[Repeat chorus]

She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me

All my neon neighbors they like what I play

Every day they replace old B24
Cause every night I run a needle through ‘Walking The Floor’
Every night I run a needle through ‘Walking The Floor’

I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin E T and I'll play 'em some more

Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide awake just watching you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have
More than just the things that you need
We ain't got much now, we're just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is comin'.

Chorus:
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life.

Oh, now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're gonna fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters.

Chorus:
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones

Oh, a better life
Hey, we're gonna leave this all behind us baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're gonna break the chains that bind, and, finally we'll be free
We're gonna be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight baby...
I don't know how I'll get her off my mind - but give me time
I'll think of something
I can't say that I'm all right - but by tonight
I'll think of something
I'll find so many things to do that I wont have the time to think of her
And then if she's still on my mind I'll try to drink enough to drown the hurt
And if that don't work
I'll think of something


Where do I go for love that I still need - now that I'm free
I'll think of something
And if someday by accident we meet - and I can't speak
I'll think of something
If I can't say a word to her I'll blame it on this lump that's in my throat
And standing there what will I do to hide my love enough that it wont show
Well I don't know
But I'll think of something
Are you ready to party?

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shanandoa River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Chorus:
Country Roads, take me home
to the place I belong
West Virginia, mounty mamma
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gathered 'round her
Miner's lady stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eye

Chorus x2

I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling that I
should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Take me home, country roads
Lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala heyhey lalala
West Virginia, Mounty Mamma
Take me home, country roads

Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin

She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin

Oh, I knew there'd be Hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late... 'cause I was

(Chorus:)
Thinkin bout a little white tank top sittin right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin bout a long kiss man just gotta get
going where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin
What was I thinkin

By the county line the cops were nippin on our heals
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through a corn field
What was I thinkin

Out the other side she was hollerin faster
Took a dirt road had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin
Oh I knew there'd be Hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late... 'cause I was

(Chorus)

When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood slidin like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin, Oh what was I thinkin, Oh what was I thinkin
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again...'cause I was

(Chorus)
Well I love her
But I love to fish
I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
But today she met me at the door
Said I would have to chose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things and she'd be gone by noon

Well I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
Right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Yeah I'm gonna miss her
Oh lookie there I've got a bite alright

Now theres a chance
If I hurry
I could beg her to stay
That waters right
And the weathers perfect
No tellin' what I might catch today

So I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
Right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk throught that door tonight
Yeah I'm gonna miss her
Oh lookie there another bite

Yeah I'm gonna miss her
Oh lookie there I've got a bite
Baby, tell me where'd you ever learn
To fight without saying a word
Then waltz back into my life
Like it's all gonna be alright
Don't you know how much it hurts...

When we don't talk
When we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love

It matters to me

When I don't know what to say
Don't know what to do
Don't know of it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters to me

Baby I still don't understand
The distance between a woman and a man
So tell me how far it is
And how you can love like this
'Cause I'm not sure I can

When we don't talk
when we don't touch
When it doesn't feel like we're even in love
It matters to me

When I dont know what to say
Don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters to me

Oh and I don't know what to say
Don't know what to do
Don't know if it really even matters to you
How can I make you see
It matters------ to me

Oh it matters to me
I've been telling my dreams to the scarecrow
'bout the places that I'd like to see
I say friend do you think I'll ever get there,
Oh,but he just stands there smiling back at me

So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been praying to find
Is there a brown eyed boy in my future? Ya
And he says girl you've got nothing but time

But how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground?
When you know that were you were born
You were born to fly

My daddy he is grounded like the oak-tree
My mamma she is steady as the sun
Oh, you know I love my folks
But I keep staring down the road,
Just looking for my one chance to run

Hey, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I wander wild and free, ohh

How do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground?
When you know that you were born
You were born yeah yeah.......
You were born to fly

So how do you wait for heaven?
And who has that much time?
And how do you keep your feet on the ground?
When you know that you were born, you were born to fly

Yeah
You were born to fly, fly, fly ,fly
Heyyyyy
Ooooooooo

There's a for sale sign on a big old' rusty tractor
You can't miss it, Its the first thing that you see
Just up the road, a pale blue water tower
With "I Love Jennie" painted in bright green
Hey That's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down
And this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town

Where I was raised

Southern Nights Have You Ever Felt A
Southern Night Free As A Breeze
Not To Mention The Trees
Whistling Tunes That You Know And Love So

Southern Nights Just As Good Even When
Closed Your Eyes I Apologize
To Any One Who Can Truly Say
He Has Found A Better Way

Feel So Good Feel So Good It's Frightening
Wish I Could Stop This World From Fighting
La Da Da Da Da....

Mysteries Like This And Many Others
In The Trees Blow In The Night
In The Southern Skies

Southern Skies Have You Ever Noticed
Southern Skies It's Precious Beauty
Lies Just Beyond The Eye
It Goes Running Thru Your Soul Like The Stories Of Old

Old Man He And His Dog They Walk The Old Land
Every Flower Touched His Cold Hand
As He Slowly Walked By
Weeping Willows Would Cry For Joy
Two doors down
They're laughing and drinking and having a party
Two doors down
They're not aware that I'm around
But here I am crying my heart out feeling sorry
But they're having a party just two doors down

I think I'll dry these useless tears
And get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join them two doors down.

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinking and having a party
Two doors down
They're all aware that I'm around
Cause here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
Having a party just two doors down

I can't believe I'm standing here dry eyed, all smiles, and talking
Making conversation with the new love I found
I asked him if he'd like to be alone and we start walking
Down the hall to my place late
Two doors down.

Two doors down
They're laughing and drinking and having a party
Two doors down
We're not aware that they're around
Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
Having a love party two doors down
Crack of dawn I hit the road, set my shoulders for the heavy load
Coffee leaking through the paper sack
The foreman says I'm late again, he can't stand it when I only grin
He's got me eight hours, she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quittin' time
She got something cookin' for me tonight

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
and again

Out of gas, just my luck, four bald tires on my pickup truck
No more credit on my credit card
When I come home and hit that door
I remember what these aching arms are for
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
But she'll be burning in my mind

She keeps the homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

She keeps the homefires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

Homefires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world

While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
Whooo umm yeah...
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside ev'ry darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah

Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

Ooooo...Yeah!

There ain't no load that I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah
vI don't know why I act the way I do
Like I ain't got a single thing to lose
Sometimes I'm my own worst enemy
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

I got a life that most would love to have
But sometimes I still wake up fightin' mad
At where this road I'm heading down might lead
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness
The heart of stone I sometimes get
The things I've done for foolish pride
The me that's never satisfied
The face that's in the mirror when I don't like what I see
I guess that's just the cowboy in me

The urge to run, the restlessness

Girl I know there's times you must have thought
There ain't a line you've drawn I haven't crossed
But you set your mind to see this love on through
I guess that's just the cowboy in you

We ride and never worry about the fall
I guess that's just the cowboy in us all
I’ve known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you’ve got being right down to an art
You think you’re a genius - you drive me up the wall
You’re a regular original know-it-all

Oh-oo-oh, you think you’re special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you’re something else

Okay, so you’re a rocket scientist
That don’t impress me much
So you got the brain, but have you got the touch
Don’t get me wrong, I think you’re alright
But that won’t keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don’t impress me much

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve - just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
‘Cause Heaven forbid it should fall out of place

Okay, so you’re Brad Pitt
That don’t impress me much
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch
Don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re alright
But that won’t keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don’t impress me much

You’re one of those guys that likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can’t believe you kiss your car good night
C’mon, baby, tell me - you must be joking right!

Oh-oo-oh, you think you’re special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you’re something else

Okay, so you’ve got a car
That don’t impress me much
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch
Don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re alright
But that won’t keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don’t impress me much
You think you’re cool but have you got the touch
Don’t get me wrong, yeah, I think you’re alright
But that won’t keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don’t impress me much

Okay, so what do you think, you’re Elvis or something?…
Whatever
That don’t impress me

Is it too much to ask

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh

Is it too much to demand

Pens that won't run out of ink

Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Passionate kisses from you

Do I want too much
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
&amp;amp;quot;Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right&amp;amp;quot;

Ridin' on the City of New Orleans Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and graveyards full of old black men
And graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you? Say, don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with an old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels a rumbling neath the floor
And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
Good morning America...
[ guitar ]
Night time on the City of New Orleans changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues
Good morning America...
I feel tears wellin' up cold deep inside
like my heart's sprung a big break
and a stab of lonliness sharp and painful
that I may never shake

You might say that I was taking it hard
since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide in sorrow
when I may lay right down and bawl

Chorus

Now the race is on
and here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartaches goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My hearts out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache,
and the winner loses all

One day I ventured in love
never once suspectin' what the final result would be
and how I lived in fear of waking up each morning
finding that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
for today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
and I came out in second place

Chorus

Now the race is on
and here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartaches goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My hearts out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache,
and the winner loses all
There were no angry words at all
As we carried boxes down the hall
One by one we put them in your car
Nothing much for us to say
One last goodbye and you drove away
I watched your tail-lights
As they faded in the dark
I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed
So I laid down on the couch instead

Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But oh this sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart

Clocks still tickin, life goes on
Radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I've got to face
You call to see if I'm okay
Look out the window and I just say

Last night I prayed the Lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you
But oh this sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart

Oh,I guess the world ain't gonna stop
For my broken heart.
Sittin on the porch swing

I wish I had your pair of wings

Had them last in my dreams

I was chaising buterflies

Till the sunrise broke my eyes

Tonight the sky has glued my eyes

Cause what they see`s aa angel hive

I`ve got to touch that magic star

And greet the angels in their hive

Sometimes I wish I were an angel

Sometimes I wish I were you

And all the sweet honey from above

Pour it all over me sweet love

And while you`re flying around my head

Your honey kisses keep me fed

I wish I had your pair of wings

Just like last night in my dreams

I was lost in paradise

Wish i`d never opened my eyes

Sometimes I wish I were an angel

Sometimes I wish I were you

But there`s danger in the air

Tryin` so hard to be unfair

Danger`s in the air

Tryin`so hard to give us a scare

But were not afraid

Sometimes I wish I were an angel

Sometimes I wish I were you

Wish I were you

Oh I wish I were you
Now Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
He never was a hero, or this county's shinin' light
But you could always find him standing up
For what he thought was right

He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

Now we might have been better off or owned a bigger house
If Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backing down
But we always had plenty just living his advice
Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight

He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

Now I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's days
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed

You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
Feeling better, now that we're through
Feeling better 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I see how you really are

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
I wouldn't blame him if he said to me

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm telling you now, baby
And I'm going my way
Forget about you, baby
'Cause I'm leaving this day

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
Oh, oh no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby you're no good
All my friends say, I should leave you alone
You've got a heart like a stone, And a wonderin' eye
And I know that they're right
I can make up my mind, Not to see you again,
But you move through my dreams like the wind,
It's no good to pretend, It won't happen again,
Cause it'll happen again.

Some fools never learn
Play with the fire,
And your gonna get burned
It's only love when your loved in return
Some fools never learn.
Some fools never learn.

And baby I tried, But I'm just not that strong,
Yes, I knew all along, But that's not enough
I was falling in love
And you don't know it, But I came over tonight,
There was somebody's car parked outside
Damn my eyes, Damn this heart of mine
I drove off into the night.

Some fools never learn.
Play with the fire,
And your gonna get burned
It's only love when your loved in return
Some fools never learn.
Some fools never learn.

Somewhere in the city tonight,
There's a girl and she's lonely like me,
She'll be easy to see
And naturally, She'll have that look in her eyes,
She'll be feeling that way
I see it all plain as day
Oh, I'll never be, what she wants me to be
Oh, but lucky for me.

Some fools never learn
Play with the fire,
And your gonna get burned
It's only love when your loved in return
Some fools never learn.

Some fools never learn.
Some fools never learn...


I called, collect on the phone
You say you're tired and alone
But it sounds like someone else is lying there
She said, "Don't call me no more"
Don't you knock on my door
Its too late now and I know you'll never change
She said, "You're just a Coca Cola cowboy"
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you walked across my heart like it was Texas
And you taught me how to say I just don't care
She said just leave me alone
And let me hang up this phone
'Cause he'll see me cry and think I still love you
Please don't call me no more
I changed the locks on my door
It's time you understood that we are through
She said, "You're just a Coca Cola cowboy"
You got an Eastwood smile and Robert Redford hair
But you…
And he'll tell her he's working late again
But she knows too well there's something going on
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone

Lord, it hurts her doing this again
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs to give her body to

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day

When it's over, there's no peace of mind
Just a longing for the way things should have been
And she wonders why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend

Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
They don't want to hurt the others

Making money at thirty with a wife and a son Then a short five years later it all comes undone She�s gone back to mama with the boy by her side Now I�m blind drunk and running with them on my mind I�m on the backside of thirty and back on my own An empty apartment don�t feel like a home On the backside of thirty, the short side of time Back on the bottom with no will to climb It�s dawn Monday morning and I just called in sick I skipped work last Friday to drink this much red And when my friends ask me I�ll tell them I�m fine But my eyes tell the story that my lies can�t hide I�m on the backside of thirty and back on my own An empty apartment don�t feel like a home On the backside of thirty, the short side of time Back on the bottom with no will to climb
Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though i went through some nights

Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow i made it through the heartache
Yes i did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (i know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep i didn't falter
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was !ow it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire i kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment, no i don't looking hack
When i think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (i know you do), i just laugh

When the river was deep i didn't fairer
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we snared was meant to be
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting , knew you were waiting for me
He wore that cowboy hat
To cover up his horns
Sweet talkin' forked tongue
Had a tempting charm
Before I turned around
That girl was gone
All I can say is
Bartender pour me something strong

chorus:
Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil
Drives a Coup de Ville
I watched him drive away over the hill
Not against her will
And I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

It was long and chrome
Sittin' in the lot
Fire engine red
That thing was hot
He reved it up
She waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell
And so have I

Chorus(2 times)
Pardon me you left your tears on the jukebox
and I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry it's just that i noticed you, goin out of your mind
It look like we're two of a kind

Chorus
Let's fall to pieces together
why should we both fall apart
lets fall to pieces together
right here in eachother's arms

alone is much better together
when the worst is still yet to come
so lets share the rest of the tears that are left
from two hearts that just came undone
why should we go crazy alone

repeat chorus

Let's fall to pieces together, right here, in eachother's arms

Excuse me, ma'am, can you help me
I need to place an ad with you today
No ma'am, tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away

What's that, no this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes ma'am, I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read

"Wanted one good hearted woman
To forgive imperfection
In the man that she loves
Wanted just one chance to tell her
How much he stills loves her
He can't be sorry enough"

What's that, no thats all I wanna say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes ma'am, she means everything
I hope she comes back when she reads these words

Wanted one good hearted woman
To forgive imperfection
In the man that she loves
Wanted just one chance to tell her
How much he stills loves her
He can't be sorry enough

I'm walking the floor over you I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two walking the floor over you

You left me and you went away you said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you...
[ guitar + steel ]
Now someday you may be lonesome too walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt your pride
Remember that I loved you and I will the day I die
I'm walking the floor over you...
A high roller even when the chips are down
To win her over, I'd seen the tables turn around
She's ten the hard way, I can feel it in my bones
She'll be makin' my day and not another night alone
'Til it's time for a windfall and not a single minute too soon
I've been too long overdue, now I'm gonna shoot the moon

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

I've been to the table, and I've lost it all before
I'm willin' and able, always comin' back for more
Squeezin' out a thin dime 'til there's no one hanging on my arm
I've gambled on a third time, a fool will tell you it's a charm
If I'm bettin' on a loser, I'm gonna have a devil to pay
But it's the only game I know to play, it doesn't matter anyway

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line

I'd bet it all on a good run of bad luck
Seven come eleven and she could be mine
Luck be a lady, and I'm gonna find love comin' on the bottom line
You could have given me a million reasons why
But it wouldn't change a thing
You said it all when you said goodbye
And you took off your wedding ring

I've been tryin' to get over you
I've been spending time alone
I've been tryin' to get over you
But it'll take dyin' to get it done

All my friends keep tryin' to fix me up
They say I need somebody new
When it comes to love, I've all but given up
'Cause life don't mean nothin' without you

I've been tryin' to get over you
I've been spending time alone
I've been tryin' to get over you
But it'll take dyin' to get it done

Just another day without you.
I'll be okay without you .
I'll be fine.
I'll be alright.

I'll find some one new without you.
Somebody just like you but not you.
I'll be alright.
Say I'll be alright.

But I'm breaking apart inside.
I'm breaking apart inside.
I cry in my sleep at night.
I'm breaking apart without you.

I hardly ever think about you.
I said I'd call but I don't need to.
I'll be fine.

I've got so much to do without you.
I said that I'd be lost without you.
I'll be fine.
Just give me time.

Cause I'm breaking apart inside.
I'm breaking apart inside.
I cry in my sleep at night.
I'm breaking apart without you.

And I'm hoping, you're doing fine too

I don't wanna sleep without you.
Dreams don't mean a thing without you.
I feel so alone without you.
Baby come back I need you.

I'm breaking apart inside.
I'm breaking apart inside.
I cry in my sleep at night.
I'm breaking apart without you.

And I'm wondering, if you're doing fine too.
All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, ev'ry note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are apart
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shinin' soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Where did the bastard run
Is he still around
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby
I'm gonna get a gun
Shoot the lover down
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby
Traces are everywhere
In our happy home
Now you better tell me everything you did baby
I jumped out of my easy chair
It was not my own
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby

chorus:
I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later
(Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening)

You know how people talk
I wonder what they say
I think you better tell me everything you did baby

Chorus:
I never knew you
You were a roller skater
You gonna show me later

You never came to me
When you were so inclined
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby
I know where baby's at
I know your filthy mind
Now you're gonna do me everything you did baby
(Barbara George)

I know (I know) you don't love me no more
No more (no more) no, no more (no more)
And I don't want to be hurtin' anymore
(No more) anymore (no more)
Yeah, yeah I have loved so hard
Everything I did was no (????)
If I can't love you right, baby
I don't have to love you at all

I know (I know) you don't want me no more
No more (no more) no, no more (no more)
And it had to be someone else loving you more
(No more) loving you more (no more)
Ain't no use in me cryin' now
If not for you I wouldn't be down
Since you don't want me no more, baby
Ain't no use in your hanging round

She packed my bags last night, preflight
Zero hour, nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high
As a kite by then

I miss the earth so much
I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse
Up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ah, no no no...
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man
Burnin' out his fuse
Up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place
To raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them
If you did

And all this science
I don't understand
It's just my job
Five days a week
A Rocket Man
Rocket Man

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

And I think it's gonna be a long, long, time(7x)
If my old truck was a horse
I'd have to shoot it
Lord the day my ship came in
I was waiting for a train

Everytime I get a grip, I always lose it
I can't find the sunshine for the rain
And you know I'm always saying I'm sorry
But you stand by me through it all

Seems everytime I make my mark
Somebody paints the wall

Everytime I think I'm off and runnin
I'm barely up to a crawl
Everytime I get a leg up on the ladder of success
I slip and fall

Like last week down at the factory
I was up for a promotion


But the boss says little brother got the call

Seems everytime I make my mark
Somebody paints the wall

Everytime I think I'm off and runnin
I'm barely up to a crawl

Everytime I get a leg up
On the ladder of success, I slip and fall

Seems everytime I make my mark
Somebody always paints the wall
Sitting at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applyin' booze
The talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted
There was no need to talk about it
They were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose

She said, "You don't look like my type, but I guess you'll do"
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
And he said, "I'll even tell you that I love you, if you want me to"
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous

When they left the bar, they got in his car, and they drove away
He drove to the Family Inn
She didn't even have to pretend she didn't know what for
Then he went to the desk, and made his request while she waited outside
Then he came back with the key and she said
"Give it to me and I'll unlock the door"

She kept sayin', "I've never done this kind of thing before, have you"
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
And he said, "Yes I have, but only a time or two"
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
When I walked in the band just started
The singer couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.
Was on a mission to drown her memory but
I thought no way with all this ruckus.

But after one round with Jose Cuervo
I caught my boots tappin 'long with the beat.
And after two rounds with Jose Cuervo
That band was sounding pretty darn good to me.

--- Instrumental ---

Then some stranger asked me dance
And I revealed to her my two left feet.
Said, ''Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an old memory.''

Then after three rounds with Jose Cuervo
I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showin' off moves never seen before.

Well, around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget.
After round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole dang place!

After nine rounds with Jose Cuervo
They were countin' me out and I was about to give in
The after ten rounds with Jose Cuervo
I lost count and started countin' again!

One round with Jose Cuervo
I went two rounds with Jose Cuervo
Three rounds with Jose Cuervo
Five rounds with Jose Cuervo or was it four?
Six rounds with Jose Cuervo
Eight rounds with Jose Cuervo
Ten rounds with Jose Cuervo...
Well, I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl
To the music of an old juke box
But when my money's all gone
I'm on the telephone
Singing, hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well, now I'm living wild and dangerously
But I've got plenty of company
When the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Well, I can't wait to see the lights of town

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop
I love to give the girls a whirl

Singing, hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Well, I'm a honky tonk man

To the music of an old juke box
And when my money's all gone
I'm on the telephone
Singing, hey hey mama can your daddy come home

Hey now, a pretty little girl and a jug of wine
Well, that's what it takes to make a honky tonk time
With the juke box moaning those honky tonk sounds
I can't wait to lay my money down

'Cause I'm a honky tonk man
And I can't seem to stop

I live in an apartment on the 99th floor of my block
And I sit at home looking out the window imagining the world has stopped
Then in flies a guy who's all dressed up just like a Union Jack
And says, "I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack"

I said hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

The telephone is ringing I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"
A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?" "Well, I guess I'm doin' fine"
He says, "It's 3 AM, there's too much noise, don't you people ever wanna go to
bed?
Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have to drive me out of my head?"

I said hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtown
It was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul around
I laid myself out, I was so tired, and I started to dream
In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like rags stuck on my window screen

I said hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Don't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby

Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud
Hey (Hey), you (You), get off of my cloud

Don't hang around, baby two's a crowd on my cloud, baby
We don't have time left to regret
Hold on
It will take more than common sense
Hold on
So stop your wonderin', take a stand
Hold on
there's more to life than just to live
Hold on

Cause an empty room can be so loud
There's too many tears to drown them out
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on

One single smile, a helping hand
Hold on
It's not that hard to be a friend
Hold on

When you love someone and they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hold on

If it falls apart
And you're feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don't forget to

Have faith, restart
Just hold on

oh i'm sorry i forgot where i was
I try to think about Elvis
Memphis
Oprah in the afternoon
I try to think about palm trees
Fig leaves
The creature from the black lagoon
I try to think about high heels
And good deals
Anything to get me through
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days

I try to contemplate the cosmos
What goes
Round and round the sky at night
I try to think about champagne
Freight trains
Slowly rolling out of sight
I try to focus on the headlines
Street crimes
Everytime I think I might
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days

My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do

My mind wanders where it will
When it settles right on you
I forget what I should say
I forget what I should do

come on patty get it together

I try to think about Shakespeare
Leap year
The Beatles or the Rolling Stones
I try to think about hair-do's
Tattoos
Sushi bars and saxophones
I try to think about the talk shows
New clothes
But I guess I should have known
I just can't concentrate
You're all I think about these days
You're all I think about these days
These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door "Y'all remember to wipe your feet"
And then she said "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge"
"Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please"
"There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow"
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
"I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right"
"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge"
"And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And Mama said to me "Child, what's happened to your appetite?"
"I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite"
"That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today"
"Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way"
"He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge"
"And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Worried sick my eyes are hurting
To rest my head I'd take a life
Outside the girls are dancing
'Cause when you're down it just don't seem right

Feeling second fiddle to a dead man
Up to my neck with your disregard
Like a beat dog that's walking on the broadway
No one wants to hear you when you're down

Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name

A flip of a coin
Might make a head turn
No surprise, who sleeps
Held my hand over a candle
Flame burnin' but I never weep

Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name

What a shame

(Repeat 2nd Chorus)
Well
I know
I've been out of style for a short while
But I don't care how cold you are
I'm coming home soon
I'm gonna make you a star
yeah.
Well
he says he's into his music but I don't believe him
He just doesn't seem to understand the rock media
Well
I know
I'm not super hip and I'm liable to take a slip
But I don't care how cold you are
I'm coming home soon.
I'm gonna make you a star

We gonna make you a star

Oh

too much more than a pretty face
. . .
Star yeah
yeah

We gonna make you a star
haa
haa.
I wanna tell you a story every man ought know
If you want a little lovin' you gotta start real slow
She gonna love you tonight if you just treat her right

Oh, squeeze her real gentle, you gotta make her feel good
Tell her that you love her like you know you should
She gonna love you tonight if you just treat her right

If you practice my method just as hard as you can
You gonna get a reputation as a lovin' man
Yeah, you'll be glad every night that you treated her right

Hey, hey, hey

Gotta squeeze her real gentle, you gotta make her feel good
And tell her that you love her like you know you should
She gonna love you all night if you just treat her right

If you practice my method just as hard as you can
You gonna get a reputation as a lovin' man
Yeah, you'll be glad every night that you treated her right

Hey

If you practice my method just as hard as you can
You gonna get a reputation as a lovin' man
Then you'll be glad every night that you treated her right
He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck,
and he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck.
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck,
I thought that he walked on water.

He said he was a cowboy when he was young.
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,--
and I thought that he walked on water.


CHORUS

If the story's told, only heaven knows.
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo.
And although his wings, they were never seen.
I thought that he walked on water.

Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,
and said, &amp;amp;quot;Son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot.&amp;amp;quot;
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed alot.
Then I'd flop down beside him.

And he was ninety years old in sixty-three
and I loved him and he loved me.
And lord, I cried the day he died,

'cause I thought that he walked on water.

CHORUS
Can't concentrate on the preacher preaching
My attention span done turned off
I'm honed in on that angel singing
Up there in the choir loft

She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination
A college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher
A dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me

Her second cousin was my third grade teacher
I used to cut her grandma's grass
Back then she was nothin' but knees and elbows
Golly did she grow up fast

She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination
A college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher
A dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me

Lord if you got any miracles handy
Maybe you could grant me one
Just let me walk down the aisle
And say I do
To that angel with a choir robe on

She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
More laughs than a stack of comic books
A wild imagination
A college education
Add it all up it's a deadly combination
She's a good bass fisher
A dynamite kisser
Country as a turnip green
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And look who's lookin' at me
She's got her daddy's money
Her mama's good looks
And she's lookin' at me
You said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck,
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,
On backroads at night
An' I was right there beside him all summer long
An' then the time we woke up to find that summer'd gone

But when you think: Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long:
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness,
I hope you think: "That little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest,
An' my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears,
An' thankin' God that you weren't here,
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed,
Is a letter that you never read,
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,
An' lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe:

When you think: Tim McGraw,
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long:
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness,
I hope you think: "That little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest,
An' my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then:
I'm standin' on your street,
An' there's a letter left on your doorstep,
An' the first thing that you'll read:

Is: "When you think: Tim McGraw,
"I hope you think my favorite song"
Some day you'll turn your radio on,
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness,
I hope you think: "That little black dress"
Think of my head on your chest,
An' my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw,
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me,
Mmmm

You said the way my blue eyes shined,
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie"
You’re so complicated - you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don’t appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they’re on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I’m really feelin’ frustrated
Why don’t you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you’ll see

Don’t freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It’s definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don’t freak out until you know the facts
Relax - Max

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Don’t be stupid - you’re my baby

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible
Mama always prayed that I'd be a better man than Daddy
And I determined not to let her down
Deserted by the man she loved
And left to raise four children
We were the local gossip of the town

I promised her that I'd live right
And not be like the others
But I wound up in jail on Christmas Day
I told her I'd be home and not to worry 'bout my brothers
When I got home my Mom had passed away

CHORUS:
And I hear tell the road to hell
Is paved with good intentions
But Mama my intentions were the best
There's lots of things in my life
I'd just as soon not to mention
Looks like I turned out like all the rest
But Mama my intentions were the best

A little boy with big blue eyes
A-beggin' to go fishin'
I promised him but never took the time
Now they won't let me see him
And I sit here a-wishin'
Wishin' I could hold him one more time

CHORUS:
And I hear tell the road to hell
Is paved with good intentions
But Mama my intentions were the best
There's lots of things in my life
I'd just as soon not to mention
Looks like I turned out like all the rest
But Mama my intentions were the best
But Mama my intentions were the best
Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be
A lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Well remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Cuz you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you've tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be
A lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

(sax solo)

You may be right
I may be crazy
But It just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right

You may be wrong but you may be right
You may be wrong but you may be right
(repeat till end)
Brothers and sisters, put this record down
Take my advice 'cause we are bad news
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose

It's just past 8
And I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says
''Do not open before Christmas"

We're only liars, but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense

Brothers and sisters, ya put these words down
Into your notebook, spit lines like these
We're friends when you're on your knees
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet

It's just past 8
And I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says
"Do not open before Christmas"

We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense

We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend

We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trend
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense.
These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
She got eyes that cut you like a
knife and
lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

You know I've never been the type that would ever want to
stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askin why it is
I tell them I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
it comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is

Now when she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
When she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

You got whatever it is
It blows me away
You're everything I wanted to say to a woman
but couldn't find the words to say
You got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
it comes out "I love" "i do"
You got whatever it is
When the night has come
And our land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long as you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me,
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, to stand by me

And if the sky we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should fall to the sea
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long, just as long as you stand by me

Darlin', stand by me,
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, stand by me

--- Instrumental ---

Darlin', stand by me,
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, stand by me

Darlin', stand by me,
Won't you stand by me
You'll be needed, stand, stand by me...
When I'm feelin' lonely,
Someone telephone me,
It's gettin' hard to pass my time.

Take me out'a dieing,
Watch me while I'm flyin',
Baby, it's a waste of time.

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man, to make my dreams come true.

Say that you will find him,
Creeping up behind him,
Moving round' the town all day.

Well, I'm underestimated,
Highly underated,
Can there be another way?

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man, and I need a man.

And then I won't be feelin' lonely,
Knowing I'm the only one.

He'll understand,
Oh, what I'm feelin' deep inside me,
Knowing that at last he's gone.

Oh well,
Gettin' tired of lookin',
Wastin' all my cookin,
Ending in a dreadful row.

Can somebody tell me,
Say to me, or sell me,
Why I'm feelin' lonely, oh.

I need a man, perhaps a man like you,
I need a man to make my dreams,
And I need a man.

And at night I won't be lonely,
Knowing I'm the only one.

He'll understand,
Oh, what I'm feelin' deep inside me,
Knowing that at last he's gone.

It's maybe that I'm dreaming,
Can't say they I've seen him,
Somehow, I just got to find.

Someone outstanding,
Goes without [?],
[?]

I need a man like you, to make my dreams come true,
Perhaps that man is you!
A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all dressed up for the dance
A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue blue mood.

I'm all dressed up for the dance
I'm all alone in romance

Once you told me long ago
To the prom with me you'd go
Now you've changed your mind it seems
Someone else will hold my dreams

A white sports coat and a pink carnation
I'm in a blue blue mood.
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her crying
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind.

Yes I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plan
The way Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close as she danced with me.

She said I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer
And so I thought I'd better let you know.

Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her crying
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind...
Should've been different, but it wasn't different was it
Same old story and Dear John and so long
It should have fit like a glove
It should've fit like a ring, like a diamond ring
A token of a true love
Should've all worked out but it didn't
She should be here now but she isn't

There's your trouble, There's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now your thinkin' bout all your missin'
How deep your sinkin'
Round and round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up for better luck

Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

There's your trouble, There's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble, There's your trouble
Keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble,
There's your trouble

There's your trouble,
There's your trouble

There is your truoble
I used to come home late and not a minute too soon
Barkin' like a dog, howlin' at the moon
You'd be mad as an ol' wet hen
Up all night wonderin' where I've been
I'd fall down and say come help me honey
You laughed out loud, I guess you thought it was funny
But I've sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Now I'm paintin' the house and I'm mendin' the fence
I guess I've gone and lost all my good sense
Too much work is hard for your health
I could've died drinkin' now I'm killing myself
And I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this, honey do that
I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Now I'm fixin' the sink and I'm mowin' the grass
And now you've made me a list and I'm bustin' my... well
All broke down tails been dragin'
It's a rough old life up here on the wagon
I'm feedin' the dog, sackin' the trash
It's honey do this, honey do that
I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'

Yeah I sobered up and I got to thinkin'
Girl you ain't much fun since I quit drinkin'
You look surprised, you didn't think you'd see me,
Kickin' up my heels, paintin' up this town,
When you said goodbye,
I learned a couple new dances,
Cast a couple of glances, I'm on a big roll now.

Chorus:
Except for Monday, which was never good anyway,
Tuesday, I get a little sideways,
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite,
Thursday and Friday take too long,
Before I know it, Saturday's gone,
But it's Sunday now
And you can bet that I'm alright.

Instrumental

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't always this easy,
Gettin' over you, got a little rough on me,
It didn't take too long, 'til I got it together
And everyday I thank my lucky stars,
You set me free.

Except for Monday, which was never good anyway,
Tuesday, I get a little sideways,
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite,
Thursday and Friday take too long,
Before I know it, Saturday's gone,
But it's Sunday now
And you can bet that I'm alright.

Repeat Chorus

It's Sunday now and everything's alright.

You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby... I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralysed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam some 1oo times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Oh Ruby.. For god's sake turn around
Starin' at you takin' off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do but baby you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder

Wait, baby don't moved, right here it is
T-shirt hanging off Dogwood Bridge
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah for me
You don't look a day over Fast Cars and Freedom
That sunset river back first time feeling

Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up you're standing on the front porch
Looking just like that remember that

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
It was 1989
My thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man

She was seventeen
And she was far from in-between
It was summertime in northern Michigan

Splashing through the sandbar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where

We didn't have no internet
But man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love down by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

Catching walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul

We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock n' roll

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love down by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange
As when the leaves begin to change
Or how we thought those days would never end

Sometimes I hear that song
And I start to sing along
And think "Man, I'd love to see that girl again"

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love down by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long

And we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love down by the lake to our favorite song

Sipping whiskey out the bottle
Not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
Singing "Sweet Home Alabama" all summer long
I was twenty and she was eighteen,
We were just about as wild as we were green,
In the ways of the world.
Well she picked me up in that red rag top,
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops,
On a summer night, running all the red lights.

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal burning stove.
We were cooking with gas
knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be, for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school,
And life was fast and the world was cruel,
We were young and wild, we decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets in the morning light,
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end,
No I can't say where she is today,
I can't remember who I was back then.

Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins,
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time, drive you outta� your mind.
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday,
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet and her eyes were green,
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me (2x)
Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind
When a melody does find a rhyme
Says to me I'm comin' home to stay
Oh, Lord, home to stay
I'm comin' home to stay
Home to stay

Ah, lord, it's just the same old story
Something about love for glory
A nickel and a dime a dozen
Fame
Ah, it's such a shame
Ah, the way they use your name
Ah, you know it's such a shame
When it's only mine to sing a song
Hoping that you'd cross along my way
Before I have to move along
Ah, now move along
Ah, but I'll be back again
Ooh back again

Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind
When a melody does find a rhyme
Says to me I'm comin' home to stay
Oh, Lord, home to stay
I'm comin' home to stay
Home to stay

Sleep late now mama
Let the mornin' sun warm your bed
While I'm away
While I'm away
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!

Somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on
My own-I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyesLord
somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me-somebody to love?

(He works hard) Everyday-I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I`m goin` crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Aw they ain't got no common sense
He's got nobody left to believe in

ooh ooh ooh ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Can anybody find me to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I`m alright, I`m alright
I ain`t gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I`m gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Somebody, somebody
Somebody find me
Somebody find me someone to love

Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Find me somebody, somebody, somebody to love

Find me find me find me find me find me
Ooh somebody to love

Anybody, anyway
Anybody find me somebody to love?

Yeah, yeah

Love
I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That’s when I run to you

Chorus
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you’re the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin’ right on through
And our love’s the only truth
That’s why I run to you

Repeat Chorus X 2
Written and Composed by Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard.

Dead bull with the life from the low

Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Deep fried, gimme some more

Space flunky, four on the floor
Fortified with the liqour store

i knew i could never hold that girl
she was born to see the world
all i got is a picture she mailed me
barefoot in the snowwhite sand
bag of seashells in her hand
she finally found a paradise it seems

*chorus*
on the coast of somewhere beautiful
tradewinds blowin through her hair
sunlight dancin on the water
and i wish i was there
dont know how im gonna find her
and all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful
runnin with my heart

sometimes when the sun goes down
shadows fall across this little town
and i close my eyes and i drift away...
to another place and another time
when the world was ours and she was mine
i dream of holdin her again some day

*chorus*
on the coast of somewhere beautiful
tradewinds blowing through her hair
sunlight dancin on the water

runnin with my heart

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old things they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
Cause Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on

So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord will soon be over
My daddy always was a gentleman
Never the kind who ever forced his hand
He would always be the last one to raise his voice
If anybody ever put us down
Well, you can bet that he would stand his ground
And he would tell me "Son, sometimes you got no choice."

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you wanna finish last
You got to kick a little

Some people judge you by the way you look
They see you once and say you ain't no good
Feels like they're never gonna take you for who you are
That's when you have to stand up and be strong
And go the extra mile to prove 'em all wrong
Just remember when they push you way too far

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you wanna finish last
You got to kick a little

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you wanna finish last
You got to kick a little
Well I don't look good in no Armani suits,
No Gucci shoes - or designer boots,
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z,
But there's just one thing that looks good on me.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

I'm not satisfied with Versace style,
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file,
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good,
But there's only one thing that fits like it should.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

Yeah it's you - it could only be you,
Nobody else will ever do,
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to,
Ya we stick like glue.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

The only thing I want - Yeah,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.
Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though i went through some nights

Consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow i made it through the heartache
Yes i did. I escaped.
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (i know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep i didn't falter
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was !ow it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me

With an endless desire i kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
Like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over, one touch and you set me free
I don't regret a single moment, no i don't looking hack
When i think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (i know you do), i just laugh

When the river was deep i didn't fairer
When the mountain was high i still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me
I knew you were waiting. I knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
I know this love we snared was meant to be
I knew you were waiting, knew you were waiting
I knew you were waiting , knew you were waiting for me
Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss,
I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Everytime I call my baby, to try to get a date
My boss says,
No dice, son, you gotta work late
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom 'n' papa told me, "Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Now you can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nation
Well I called my congressman and he said quote
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Yeah, sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
No there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
They packed up all his buckles
And shipped his saddle to his dad
And by the way the house looked
She must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday
To fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy
The night she got the call

He was up in Wyoming
And drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn out
Well it turned out that he lied
And all the dreams that they'd been livin'
In the California sand
Died right there beside him in Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

They never found her body
Just her diary by her bed
It told about the fight they had
And the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'
She said then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne

They say she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That you can go down by the water
And see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Nobody can explain it
Some say she's still alive
They even claim they've seen her
On the shoreline late at night
So if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
'Cause every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne

Every night she walks the beaches of Cheyenne
an old cowboy went ridin out one dark and windy day
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
when all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
plowin through the ragid skies and up a cloudy draw

their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
for he saw the riders comin hard and he heard their mournful cries

chorus:

yippie i ohhh ohh ohh
yippie i aye ye ye
ghost riders in the sky

their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
their shirts all soaked with sweat
he's ridin hard to catch that herd
but he aint caught em yet
cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
on horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries

as the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
''if you wanna save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range
then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

yippie i ohhh oh oh
yippie i aye ye ye
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky
ghost riders in the sky
Some people I know have given up on their lives
Drowning their sorrows, and mumblin', and forgot the fight
We can tip the balance we can break those barriers down
Little things count as much as the big and turn it all around

And it's oh, don't always look at the rain
No, don't look at the rain

Some people I know have lost their feel for mystery
They say everything has got to be proved, this isn't a nursery
And Joseph who's five years old, stops fights in his playground yard
No more fights and bigotry, oh is it so hard

And it's oh, don't always look at the rain
No, don't always look at the rain
Ha, don't always look at the rain

And tell me, is it a crime to have an ideal or two
Evolving takes it's time, we can't do it all in one go
Doesn't have to drive us all mad, we can only do our best
Let the mind shut up, and the heart do the rest

I'm gonna be here for you baby AND
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

I wanna honor your mother AND
I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw AND
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss
(YES I AM)

And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us, (OH-O)
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you, (BABY)
And I'll win your trust making memories of us

Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy had a hand in a still
We brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

Chorus:
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

--- Instrumental ---

Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin' and thunder started crashin'
Shhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

Chorus:
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

--- Instrumental ---

Well, a city slicker came and he said I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff
He took one s-slug and drank it right down
And I heard him a moaning as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'.

Chorus:
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers, too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were looking, tryin to book him,
But my pappy kept a-cookin'
Whshhhoooh . . . white lightnin'...

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind,
Lose the shirt off your back,
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare...

This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think
"What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big ol' heart
You find out who your friends are...

Everybody wants to slap your back
Wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way
Then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then

This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off.

You find out who your friends are


Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think
"What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big ol' heart
You find out who your friends are...

When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think
"What's in it for me?"
Or "It's way too far"
They just show on up
With their big ol' heart
You find out who your friends are...

You find out who your friends are...

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Man I been there
Or get yourself in a bind
Lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare...
Man I been there
Man I been there...
Suppose I called you up tonight
And told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think
I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
If I told you that I realize you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too
And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

CHORUS:
I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

If got down on my knees
And told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old-time feeling
Would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too
And that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I return
And we'd live and love forever
And that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the table's finally turned
Would you say

CHORUS:
I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back
And asking me to take you in
I told you so but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

And now I've foudn somebody new
And you will never break my heart in two again

At first she's gonna come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile

Your gonna give her all your heart
Then she'll tear your world apart
Your gonna cry a little while
Still she'll leave you with a smile

Well you can't help but wonder
Why you can't help but love her
But you can't help but love her
And all that hurtin' was more than worth it
It's written all over your face

One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be
She'll say hello and walk on by
Then she'll leave you with a smile

Your gonna give her all your heart
Then she'll tear your world apart
Your gonna cry a little while
Still she'll leave you with a smile

At first she's gonna come on strong
Like she'll love you all night long
Like it's going out of style
Then she'll leave you with a smile

Oh she's gonna love you
She's gonna leave you with a smile
Oh, she's gonna love you
She's gonna leave you with a smile

Time, flowing like a river
Time, beckoning me
Who knows when
We shall meet again, if ever
But time keeps flowing
Like a river to the sea

Goodbye my love
Maybe for forever
Goodbye my love
The tide waits for me
Who knows when

Gone forever
Gone forevermore

She said I'm going out with my girlfriends
margaritas at the holiday inn
oh mercy...my only thought
was tequila makes her clothes fall off

I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks patron
her closets missing half the things she bought
tequila makes her clothes fall off

She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
lose an earring in her drink
leave her jacket in the bath room stall
drop a contact down the sink

Yeah them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
if the d j puts bon jovi on
she might come home in a tablecloth
tequila makes her clothes fall off

Waoh

she can handle any champaigne brunch
bridal shower with bacardi punch
jello shooters full of smirnoff...
but tequila makes her clothes fall off

chorus

she don't mean nothing
she's just having fun
tomorrow she'll say
oh what have I done
her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
cause tequila makes her clothes fall off
I've got a funny feeling
The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
The way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again
Kiss me again
I had all but given up on finding
The one that I could fall into
On the day before you

I was ready, settled for
Less than love and not much more
There was no such thing as a dream come true
Oh, but that was all the day before you

Now you're here and everything changes
Suddenly life means so much
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow
And find out this promise is true
I will never have to go back to
The day before you

In your eyes I see forever
Makes me wish that my life never knew
The day before you

But heaven knows those years without you
Was shaping my heart for the day that I found you
You're the reason for all that I've been through
Then I'm thankful for the day before you

Now you're here and everything changes
Suddenly life means so much
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow
And find out this promise is true
I would never have to go back to
The day before you

Was the last day I ever had to live alone
And I'm never going back
No, I'm never going back

Now you're here and everything changes
Suddenly life means so much
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow
And find out this promise is true
I would never have to go back to

Yeah, I would never have to go back to
The day before you

The day before you

Well I'm an eight ball shooting double fisted drinking son of a gun

Im here for the beer and the ball busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

You know im here for the party
And i aint leavin til they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know im here, im here for the party

And if i gave em half a chance for some rowdy romance you know they would
Ive been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys and their pick up lines

Dont want no purple hooter shooter just some jack on the rocks
Dont mind me if i start that trashy talk

We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had migtha set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
My baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down


Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Lord I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size

Well I've been known to cause a few break-ups
I've been been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work

And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg, Bordeaux, France
Been makin' the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember we me
Alcohol...
Alcohol...

I got blame at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those naked pictures
Of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two
That I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head...

Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg, Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool
Out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance
I am medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember we me
Alcohol...
Alcohol...

Yeah since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg, Bordeaux, France
Been makin' the bars lots of big money
(Helpin' white people dance)
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember we me
Alcohol...

A little help from my friends
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me.
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key.

I get by with a little help from my friends,
I get high with a little help from my friends,
Going to try with a little help from my friends.

What do I do when my love is away.
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own)
No I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight,
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light,
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,
Do you need anybody,
I just need somebody to love,
Could it be anybody,
I want somebody to love.
I get by with a little help from my friends,
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,
With a little help from my friends.
GIRL OF MY BEST FRIEND

THE WAY SHE WALKS
THE WAY SHE TALKS
HOW LONG I CAN I PRETEND
OH I CAN´T HELP I´M IN LOVE
WITH THE GIRL OF MY BEST FRIEND

HER LOVELY HAIR
HER SKIN SO FAIR
I COULD GO ON AND NEVER END
OH I CAN´T HELP I´M IN LOVE

I WANT TO TELL HER HOW I LOVE HER SO
AND HOLD HER IN MY ARMS, BUT THEN
WHAT IF SHE GOT REAL MAD AND TOLD HIM SO
I COULD NEVER FACE EITHER ONE AGAIN

THE WAY THEY KISS THEIR HAPPINESS
WILL MY ACHING EVER END
OR WILL I ALWAYS BE IN LOVE
WITH THE GIRL OF MY BEST FRIEND

NEVER END
WILL IT EVER END
PLEASE LET IT END
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

(Chorus)

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

(Repeat Chorus)

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

(Repeat Chorus)

Love and only love
Love and only love
Let's chase each other 'round the room tonight
Let's play the games we played on our wedding night
To lock and bolt the door is only right
Let's chase each other 'round the room tonight

Seems like lately people love to play with fire
The other games they play are just as bad
I'd rather stay at home and feel your burning lips
And play the kind of games that make me glad

Let's don't chase around and make each other weary
Let's keep all our love at home and out of sight
Let's leave everything like jealousy behind us
And let's chase each other 'round the room tonight
American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recongnize
When we see Old Glory flying there's alot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the Army when he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye
Man,we lit up your world like the 4th of July

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass it's the American way

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Ohhh
Of the red, white, and blue
Ohhh

Baby I love you
Do you love me too
Baby I love you
Silver wings shinning in the sunlight,
roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
Their taking you away, leaving me lonley,
silver wings slowly fading out of sight.
Don't leave me i cry, don't take that airplane ride.
But you locked me out of your mind. left me
standing here behind.
Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
roaring engines headed somewhere in flight.
Their taking you away, leaving me lonley.
silver wings slowley fading out of sight.
Silver wings shining in the sunlight,
roaring engines headed somewhere in flight,
their taking you away. Leaving me lonley.
Silver wings slowley fading out of sight.
Slowley fading out of sight.
Well who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes Or the bitter direction of pending goodbyes?
I'm fallin', I'm folded, I'm wilted in place
At the sight of you standin' with streaks down your face

CHORUS: You got your heart broke, you go runnin' from the reason
Got your heart broke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin' with my heart broke

Well cryin' when you're rich is a bore if you're lonely
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield
But all is not lost, it is only mistaken
A small consolation but I know just how you feel

(chorus)

(instrumental)

Well nobody said it was goin' to be easy
We all have our weak sides that need a soft good touch.
Nobody said that it would not be worth it
But human condition continues as such

(chorus)

You kept me from leavin' with my heart broke
With my heart broke, with my heart broke
You got your heart broke
When you meet that certain someone,
You've been searchin hard to find......
It's a new love full of passion,
That can sometimes make you blind.
I don't mind being swept away,
If I know right from the start.......
So before we go much further girl,
Can I trust you with my heart?

In the time we've spent together,
I have learned to trust in you.
So many things you given....
Before I even asked you to.
But reality and romance,
Are sometimes far apart.
So, what I really need to know is......
Can I trust you with my heart?

Can I cast my cares upon you?
Can you stand the heavy load?
Can I count on you to walk me, down that long and winding road?
If you promise me these simple things, I can gurantee.....
You can always count on me.

Can I cast my cares upon you?
Can you stand the heavy load?
Can I count on you to walk me, down that long and winding road?
When two hearts souly surrender, and are sworn to understand.....
It completes a perfect union, between a woman and a man.
So please don't misunderstand me,
I don't want to go too far,
Without knowing just one answer ......
Can I trust you with my heart?
Please Girl....
Give me just one answer....
Can I trust you with my heart?
American girls and American guys
We'll always stand up and salute
We'll always recongnize
When we see Old Glory flying there's alot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

My daddy served in the Army when he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big, black eye
Man,we lit up your world like the 4th of July

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass it's the American way

Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

Ohhh
Of the red, white, and blue
Ohhh

I get out on the redneck side every now and then
Call up my baby she comes over and the party begins
She's a slick nickel she's right on the money
I wouldn't give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

She's got my number, knows my favorite songs on the jukebox
Goes to gettin' down like crazy and the whole place rocks
We'll have a few and get to feelin' right
She'll be my queen bee I'll be her neon knight
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

Oh Oh I love her so
Stand back give her room boys and watch her go

She's a looker, heads turn when she comes through the door
A show stopper when she gets to goin' out on the floor
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

Oh Oh I love her so
Stand back give her room boys and watch her go

Well, I guess it was back in '63,
When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me,
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife.
Well, she said she would, so I said, 'I do'.
But I'da said, 'I wouldn't' if I'da just knew how sayin' 'I do'
Was gonna screw up all o' my life.

Well, the first few years weren't all that bad.
I'll never forget the good times we had,
'Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support.
Well, it wasn't too long till the lust all died.
And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised,
The day I came home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch.
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock.
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said,
"Goodbye, turkey. My attorney will be in touch."
So I decided right then and there I was gonna do what's right
Give 'er her fair share but, brother,
I didn't know her share was gonna be that much.

She got the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
I got the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They split it right down the middle,
And then they give her the better half.
Well, it all sounds sorta funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

Now listen up. You ain't heard nothin' yet.
Why, they give 'er the color televison set.
Then they give 'er the house, the kids and both of the cars.
See.
Well, then they started talkin' about child support, alimony,
And the costs to the court.
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was.
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake.
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes.
Besides, everythin' I ever had worth takin' they've already took.
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony.
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney.
Askin' myself, "Why didn't you just learn how to cook?"

They give her the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
They give me the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle,
But she got the better half.
Well, it all sounds mighty funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

--instrumental break--

Well, she got the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
I got the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They split it all down the middle,
And then they give her the better half.
Well, I guess it all sounds funny,
(Ahh, ha ha ha)
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

Heh, heh. Hey, Jimmy, I got the shaft.
But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I let my wife tote it.
I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps.
You get it, judge?
I'm gonna be indebted.
That's my money.
Huh?
Contempt of court?
What do you mean I'm in contempt of court?

You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby... I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralysed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam some 1oo times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Oh Ruby.. For god's sake turn around
He works way too much for way too little
He drinks way too early till way too late
He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone
Except when he comes in here
And he's the product of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
Except when she comes in here
She's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare
In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need

She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy

Yeah, yeah
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah

Hell yeah
Turn it up
Right on
Hell yeah
Sounds good
Sing that song
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy
(Tim Nichols/Mark D. Sanders)
I been thinkin' 'bout our love situation
All this attraction in the present tense
I've reached the only logical conclusion
Love ain't supposed to make sense
This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing
Forget mathmatical equations
Self help psychology
Gray matter don't matter much darlin'
When it's gettin' down to you and me
This ain't no thinkin' thing, right brain, left brain
It goes a little deeper than that
It's a chemical, physical, emotional devotion
Passion that we can't hold back
There's nothin' that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing
There's nothing that we need to analyze
There ain't no rhyme or reason why
'Cause this ain't, this ain't no thinkin' thing
This ain't, no this ain't no thinkin' thing
Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed
Poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed
Then one day he was shooting for some food,
And up through the ground come a bubbling crude
(Oil that is, black gold, Texas tea)

Well the first thing you know old Jed's a millionaire
Kin folk said Jed move away from there
Said California is the place you oughta be
So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(Hills that is, swimming pools, movie stars)

Well now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks for kindly dropping in
You're all invited back again to this locality
To have a heaping helping of their hospitality
(Beverly Hillbillies, that's what they call 'em now,
Nice folks Y'all come back now, ya hear?)
I was getting kinda tired
Of her endless chatter
Nothing I could say
Ever seemed to matter
So I took a little drive
Just to clear my head
I saw a flashing neon up ahead
It looked like a place
To find some satisfaction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

I paid the man at the door
And pushed my way to the bar
Shouted for a drink
Over a screaming guitar
A drunk on a stool
Tried to mess with my head
But I didn't even listen
To a word he said
I knew somewhere
Amid all this distraction
Was a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
If you please
A lot more loving
Is what I need
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

Well she was fighting them off
At a corner table
She had a longneck bottle
She was peeling the label
The look on her face
It was perfectly clear
She said somebody please
Get me out of here
The look she shot me
Through the glass refraction
Said a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
If you please
A lot more loving
Is what I need
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

A little less talk
A lot more action
Let's get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action

Get on down
To the main attraction
With a little less talk
And a lot more action
I love you please believe me I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine green grass beneath my feet
Runnin' through fields of daisies a wadin' through the creek
You love me and it's invitin' to go where life is more excitin'
But I was raised on country sunshine
I was raised on country sunshine I'm happy with the simple things
A Saturday night dance a picture show and the joy that the bluebird brings
I love you please believe me I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
There's just something bout the mornin' makes each day a joy to see
Nighttime brings a peaceful feelin' to rest inside of me
I love you please believe me I wouldn't want you to ever leave me
But I was raised on country sunshine
Oh I love you please believe me...
Uh huh I was raised on country sunshine oh oh I was raised on country sunshine
I get kissed by the sun each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
this world is a beautiful place

I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones that love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

Across a crowded room,
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet and
no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

Repeat Chorus

When I, when I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know

Repeat Chorus
I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone
And a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Cryin all my tears
With the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me, yeah

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside
Feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile
And my lighted fuse
Now everytime i start to feel like that
I roll out my heart like a welcome mat

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

Laugh when i feel like it
Cry when i feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes
Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
And i've come to know
That the world won't change
Just 'cause I complain
Let the axis twirl
I'm a happy girl

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

Oh,yeah oh,yeah
I'm a happy girl
My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I wouldn't trade them for gold
Cause they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
Their woven in the stories I have told
And tell again

My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There's always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

Don't know why, don't know why
Don't know why, don't know why

My old friend, this song's for you
Cause a few a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Cause the love and the laughter
Will live long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We'll meet again, my old friend

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

My old friend, my old friend
Goodbye, goodbye
No matter what you do or say
She's always got to have her way
She'll bring you down just to cheer you up
You never know with a woman in love.

The minute you start holding on
You'll turn around and she'll be gone
This is very unpredictable stuff
You never know with a woman in love.

Chorus:
She's a lady, she's a child
She'll make you crazy, she'll drive you wild
Do you give in or do you just give up
You never know with a woman in love.
You never know with a woman in love.

I oughta know 'cause I've held a few
I've seen the things that a woman can do
She'll play the game 'til you call her bluff
Oh, You never know with a woman in love.

Just when you think you've got it all together
If you blink she'll change just like the weather, oh, oh, oh.

No matter what you do or say
She's always got to have her way
This is very unpredictable stuff
You never know with a woman in love.

She'll make you crazy, she'll drive you wild
Do you give in or do you just give up
You never know with a woman in love.

You never know with a woman in love,
You never know with a woman, oh, oh, woman in love...

Goin' to
I sure do hope this is a long night
Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling
A little more and more
Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day
Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

Nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

Two people meant to be together
Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio
Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh a rollin' down that Eastern Seaboard
I got my diesel wound up and she's a runnin' like a never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
I got my ten forward gears and a Georgia overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy and a White I been a passin' everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women but I'm not like a some other guys
I could find one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's alright
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
[ guitar ]
ICC is a checkin' on down the line
Well I'm a little overweight and my log book's way behind
But nothin' bothers me tonight I can dodge all the scales alright
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Well my rig's a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a flame from her stack and that smoke's a blowin' black as coal
My hometown's a comin' in sight if you think I'm a happy you're right
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm a gonna make it home tonight
The preacher man says it’s the end of time
And the Mississippi River she’s a goin’ dry
The interest is up and the Stock Markets down
And you only get mugged
If you go down town

I live back in the woods, you see
A woman and the kids, and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle, and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain’t too many things these ole boys can’t do
We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

Because you can’t starve us out
And you cant makes us run
Cause one-of- ‘em old boys raisin ole shotgun
And we say grace and we say Ma’am
And if you ain’t into that we don’t give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the and the western skies
And we can skin a buck; we can run a trot line
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I’d send him some homemade wine

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars my friend lost his life
Id love to spit some beechnut in that dudes eyes
And shoot him with my old 45
Cause a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

Cause you can’t starve us out and you can’t make us run
Cause one-of- ‘em old boys raisin ole shotgun
And we say grace and we say Ma’am
And if you ain’t into that we don’t give a damn

We’re from North California and south Alabam
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck; we can run a trot line
And a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive
Girl you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Cept to do the best I can
I'll be damned
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may be a real bad boy
Oh but baby I'm a real good man
Yes I am
Way back up in the country
Back in the hills
Down in the hollows where the folks are real
Livin' with the crazzies and the old wildcats
Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps
That's where I'm from and I'm proud to say
I'm from the country and I like it that way

Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way

All day long we work in the fields
Then bring it on home for a home cooked meal
We love ya like Sunday
Treat ya like Saturday night


And when the beds get full we can sleep in the hay (Hey)
We're from the country and we like it that way

Everybody knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country and we like it that way

Everybpdy knows everybody
Everybody calls you friend
You don't need an invitation
Kick off your shoes come on in
Yeah we know how to work and we know how to play
We're from the country
We're from the country
We're from the country
And we like it that way
She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Her folks shoulda seen it comin'
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
"Sorry but I got to go"
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
So the story goes

Now her daddy's in the kitchen starin' out the window
Scratchin' and a-rackin' his brains
How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little ponytail girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

Now don't you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
Nothin' quite like this
Has happened here before
Well he must have been a looker
A smooth-talkin' son of a gun
For such a brownie girl
To just up and run
'Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

Now all the biddys in the beauty shop
Gossip goin' nonstop
Sippin' on pink lemonade
How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little ponytail girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window
And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight
How could eighteen years just up and walk away?
Our little ponytail girl growed up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin out on the line

She was in the backyard
Say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
No you can't fence time
And you can't stop
Love
Move slowly to my dresser drawers
Put my blue jeans on
Find my cowboy boots,
my button down
Strap my timepiece on my arm
Grab my billfold, my pocket change
Just a mindless old routine
Then it's out the door and down the street
But it's not really me I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne And I still drive that pickup truck
That the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says I'm not the guy they've known

The lights are on, but nobody's home
Cup of coffee in the morning
Just food for the brain
But I've been numb since our last goodbye
I haven't felt a thing But now there's pains in my head
And pains in my chest
And I think I'm losing my hair I'm a half a man with half a mind
To think you didn't care

Repeat chorus
I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be.
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free.
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time.
I never thought that I would get caught.
It seemed like a perfect crime.

Baby, you left me defenseless,
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

I thought it would be so simple,
Like a thousand times before.
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away.
But I never made it to the door.
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy.
Go ahead and throw the book at me.
If lovin' you's a crime,
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

Baby, you left me defenseless.
But I've only got one plea.
Lock me away inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree.

Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Oh yeah.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree.
Love in the first degree...
Yeah....oh yeah
The only ground I ever owned
was sticking to my shoes
Now I look out my front porch
at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up
with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences
like that's where it was hung
My blessing's right in front of me
its not about the land
I'll never beat the view
from my front porch lookin' in

Chorus:
There's a carrot-top that can barely walk
with a sippy cup of milk
A little blue-eyed blonde
with shoes on wrong cuz she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
holding both of them
Yeah the view I love the most
is my front porch looking in

I've traveled here and everywhere
followin' my job
I've seen the paintings from the air
brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach
from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home
to the one He made for me
'Cuz anywhere I'll ever go
and anywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
like my front porch looking in

Chorus

I see what beautiful is about
when I'm looking in, not when I'm looking out

Chorus

Oh the view I love the most
is my front porch looking in
Yeah, yeah
Oh, that's a carrot-top that can barely walk
(from my front porch looking in)
A little blue-eyed blonde with her shoes on wrong
(from my front porch looking in)
And the most beautiful girl is holding both of them
Oh yeah
It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But, oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're goin' a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
CHORUS:
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I´m-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could di-ie
Bye bye my love goodby-eye

There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

CHORUS

I´m-a through with romance, I´m a-through with love
I´m through with a´countin´ the stars above
And here´s the reason that I´m so free
My lovin´ baby is through with me

CHORUS

Bye bye my love goodby-eye
Bye bye my love goodby-eye

FADE: Bye bye my love goodby-eye
Bye bye my love goodby-eye
True in this modern world, when two lovers get together
chances of em ever makin it to forever,
couldn't be better than two in a million hearts.
Girl this ain't just another run of the mill emotion,
What I'm feelin' the definition of devotion, my love for you is true

Chrous:
True like the sun comin' up each mornin,
Bright as the light in a baby's smile,
Sure as the mountain river winding,
Right as the rain fallin' from the sky,
Girl my love for you, is true

True not another minute on this earth can be borrowed,
so there's no way to know when i'll live my last tomorrow
but everyday i get i'll share with you
this feelin just keeps getting stronger as the time goes by
it's written on my face you can see it in my eyes
My love for you is true

Repeat Chrous x 2
(Ronnie Dunn/Terry McBride)

I thought we would always be together
The love we shared was gonna last forever
Once I was your one and only
Now here I sit, Mister Lonely

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

Beneath this dark cloud you left me under
Can't sort it out so I'll sit and wonder
Tell myself, &amp;amp;quot;It hurts, don't it&amp;amp;quot;
Now my empty heart will be forever haunted

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you
He's got you
If I could grant you one wish
I wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you baby
When you're driving me, ooh, crazy

chorus:
Ooh, I love the way you, love the way you love me
There's no where else I'd rather be
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Love me, ooh, the way you love me

It's not right, it's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you

(Chorus)

You're the million reasons why there's
Love reflecting in my eyes

(chorus til fade)
I thought I knew, the girl so well
if she was sad I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
so if she's gone the fault is mine,
I know I know, a whole lot of little things
and even though
I could list them 1 by 1,
she would still be gone

chorus:
her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64, she was born in Baton Rouge
her favorite song is " In My Life"
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
but I paid no attention to what mattered most

I never ask, she never said
and when she cried, I turned my head
she dreamed her dreams, behind closes doors
that made them easy to ignore
and I know I know
I missed the forest for the trees
and all I have to show
oh but she walked out the door
cold facts and nothing more

her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64, she was born in Baton Rouge
her favorite song is " In My Life"
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her clothes
but I paid no attention to what mattered most
her eyes are blue
her hair was long
64, she was born in Baton Rouge
her fathers tall
her mothers gone
she moved out west when she was 2
the way she laughed
the way she loved
oh my God what did I do?
You like the way that sounds?

Little Jimmy Jackson is jackin’ up his Bronco
He’s gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
All the girls are getting’ pretty sprayin’ on the White Rain
Yeah they’re gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game
Yeah

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that’s the way we get down
In a Hicktown

Well you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his woman’s’ smokin’ Pall Mall’s watchin’ Laura Ingles
And Granny’s getting’ lit she’s headin’ out to bingo
Yeah my buddies and me are goin’ muddin’ down on Blue Hole Road
You know You know

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that’s the way we get down
In a Hicktown

(Bridge)

We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

(Chorus:)
We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild yeah but that’s the way we get down
Oh Oh We let it rip when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
Its buck wild yeah but that’s the way we get down
In a Hicktown
In a Hicktown
It’s the way we get down
In a Hicktown
Yeah in a Hicktown

Oh we aint finished yet
We got you’re country boys and you’re redneck girls
It’s the party heard round the world
Right here in Hicktown
Yeah In Hicktown
The whole town’s gettin’ down
(M. Jagger/K. Richards)

Saw you stretched out in Room Ten O Nine
With a smile on your face and a tear right in your eye.
Oh, couldn't see to get a line on you, my sweet honey love.
Berber jew'lry jangling down the street,
Making bloodshot eyes at ev'ry woman that you meet.
Could not seem to get a high on you, my sweet honey love.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Make every song (you sing) your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.

When you're drunk in the alley, baby, with your clothes all torn
And your late night friends leave you in the cold gray dawn.
Just seemed too many flies on you, I just can't brush them off.
Angels beating all their wings in time,
With smiles on their faces and a gleam right in their eyes.
Whoa, thought I heard one sigh for you,
Come on up, come on up, now, come on up now.

May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Make every song you sing your favorite tune.
May the good Lord shine a light on you,
Warm like the evening sun.
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says baby is something wrong?
I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song
and he says...


Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said...

Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I could have"
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I... wrote down our song
Over the mountain
Down in the valley
Lives a former talk-show host
Everybody knows his name
He says there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
I've seen them all and man
They're all the same

Well, the sun gets weary
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the black pit town
Somebody says what's a better thing to do
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world

Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere
There's a former army post
Abandoned now just like the war
And there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's what that old army post was for

Well, the sun gets bloody
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up
On the black pit town
Somebody says what's a better thing to do
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you
This is all around the world

Over the mountain
Down in the valley
Lives the former talk-show host
Far and wide his name was known
He said there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's way we must learn to live alone
I can't stop
The way I feel
Things you do
Don't seem real
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waitin' 'rounds killin' me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get
Any rest
People say
I'm obsessed
Everything that's serious lasts
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I won't make it
On my own
No on likes
To be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

Uh huh huh

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

Uh huh huh

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
You called me up from Amarillo,
Said you were comin' to town,
I thought I'd like to tell you hello,
And drive an old friend around,
I pulled up to the airport,
Confident and cool,
But when you stepped off that plane,
I knew I was your fool,

(chorus)
My little Texas tornado,
Blowin' me away again,
I swore it wouldn't happen again,
But I looked at you and then,
I'm like a tumbleweed,
In a wild west Texas wind,
You're blowin' me away,
again,

You're lyin' with me in Atlanta,
It's such a beautiful life,
You play me like a piano,
I'll always let you get by,
I know I'll go through hell girl,
When you find someone else,
But right now I'm in heaven,
And I can't help myself,

(chorus)
My little Texas tornado,
Blowin' me away again,
I swore it wouldn't happen again,
But I looked at you and then,
I'm like a tumbleweed,
In a wild west Texas wind,
You're blowin' me away,
again
I'm like a tumbleweed,
In a wild west Texas wind,
You're blowin' me away,
(fade)
Texas tornado,
Blowin' me away again,
I swore it wouldn't happen again,
But I looked at you and then,
I'm like a tumbleweed,
In a wild west Texas wind,
You're blowin' me away.
I've been looking for you all night long, darling
You got to talk to me
I want to tell you how wrong I've been
And I won't do it again
You know that woman didn't mean a thing to me.

I hope I don't embarrass you too much
Here in front of all your friends
I'm gonna get down on my knees
Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for me, so long.

Don't take it away 'cause love don't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind.

From now on I'm gonna be the kind
Of man you can lean on
And when the waters of life
Get a little too rough or a little too deep
I'm gonna be your stepping stone
And oh, I remember all those nights
That you used to take right a hold of me
And you'd hold on.

Please let me make it, please I can't give you up
'Cause you've made love so good for mem so long.

Don't take it away, cause love can't come easy
Darling, I'm sorry I stepped over the line
Don't take it away, don't make me go crazy
'Cause I would follow you to the ends of my mind...
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

I'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train
Gonna have my breakfest with some pink champagne
I'm gonna sail the ocean, I'm gonna spread my wings
Gonna climg that mountain
gonna do everyting
I've sure enjoyed the rain,
But I'm looking forward to the sun.
You have to feel the pain,
When you lose the love you gave someone.
I thought by now that time,
Would take away these lonely tears.
I hope you're doing fine all alone,
But where do I go from here? 'cause

Without you I'm not okay,
And without you I've lost my way.
My heart's stuck in second place,
ooh,Without you.

Well I never thought I'd be
lying here without you by my side.
It seems unreal to me,
that the life you promised was a lie.
You made it look so easy,
making love into memories.
I guess you got what you wanted,
but what about me? 'cause

Without you I'm not okay,
And without you I've lost my way.
My heart's stuck in second place.
ooh ,Without you.

Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart,
That I'm better off without you.
'Cause baby I can't live,

Without you I'm not okay,
And without you I've lost my way.
My heart's stuck in second place,
ooh,
Without you
Without you
I knew the stakes were high right from the start
And when she dealt the cards I dealt my heart
Now I just found a game that I can't play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
It's time to say goodbye to yesterday
And this is where the cowboy rides away

We've been in and out of love and in-between
And now we play the final show-down scene
And as the credits roll a sad song starts to play
And this is where the cowboy rides away

And my heart is sinking like the setting sun
Setting on the things I wish I'd done
Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
And this is where the cowboy rides away

Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say
And this is where the cowboy rides away
Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on the state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die

Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in a rat race
And these days that's a special way of life

(CHORUS)
Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A mans good word and a hand shake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up down home

In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered round on a checkered board
Old men telling lies and crownin' kings

Kids drivin' round the old town square
Cops roll down int he cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

(CHORUS)
Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A mans good word and a hand shake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up down home

When I was a boy I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised

Down Home

Down Home

Folks know
If there fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up
Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A mans good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up
Down Home

Down Home
Way down home
Down home
Down Home
Way down home
I didn't see the fire burn to ashes.
I couldn't feel the winds of change.
I was lost inside the passion,
blinded by the memory of a flame.
I guess I should've felt it when you touched me.
I should've seen it in your eyes.
But I believed you really loved me .
Why can't I believe you've said goodbye.

Oh why is the last one to know
the first one to cry and the
last to let go.
Why is the one left behind
the one left alone with no one to hold.
The last one to know.

It would be easier to face the morning,
if you were holding me tonight.
But you left me without a warning.
Holding onto a heartache while she's
holding you tight.

Repeat Chorus
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful,
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything
That I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
He's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing,
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight,
Give him all her love,
Look in those beautiful eyes,
And know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing,
Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light,
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing,
Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up
But there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Well if you ask me where I come from
Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

It's a big 'ol land with countless dreams
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

There's a lady that stands in a harbor
For what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes
The price that it cost to be free

I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you, well that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey, we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

Yes there's a lady that stands in a harbor
For what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes
The price that it cost to be free

No, it ain't the only place on earth
But it's the only place that I prefer
To love my wife and raise my kids
Hey, the same way that my daddy did
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

Where the stars and stripes and the eagle...fly
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly
That lonesome Texas sun was setting slow
And in the rear view mirror, I watched it go
I can still see wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes for a moment, and I'm still there.

(CHORUS)
The bluest eyes in Texas
Are haunting me tonight
Like the stars fill the midnight sky
Her memory fills my mind
Where did I go wrong? Did I wait to long?
Or can I make things right?
The bluest eyes in Texas,
Are haunting me tonight

Another town, another hotel room.
Another dream that ended way too soon.
Left me lonely, prayin' for the dawn.
Searching for the strength to carry on.

(CHORUS)

For every heart you break, you pay a price.
But I can't forget the tears in her blue eyes.

(CHORUS)
Origionally performed by the Eagles

Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load,
I've got seven women on my mind:
four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me,
one says she's a friend of mine.
Take it easy, take it easy,
don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy.
Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand,
just find a place to make your stand and take it easy.

Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
and such a fine sight to see:
it's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford
slowin' down to take a look at me.
Come on, baby, don't say maybe.
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me.
We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again.
So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy.

Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load,
got a world of trouble on my mind.
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover,
she's so hard to find.
Take it easy, take it easy,
don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy.
Come on, baby, don't say maybe.
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me.

Oh, we got it easy,
we oughta take it easy.
I read it all every word
And I still don't understand a thing
What had you heard
What had you heard, was it love
Was it take another walk in the dark
You'll never learn
I'd pray to God if there was heaven
But heaven seems so very far from here

And it all boils down to the same thing
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams
And it all boils down to the same old pain
Whether you win or you lose isn't gonna change a single thing

I stood in line and a thought crossed my mind
I had been dreaming but I didn't mind
I signed the line and the woman looked right through me
She didn't smile
I'd pray to God if there was heaven
But heaven seems so very far from here

And it all boils down to the same old thing
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams
And it all boils down to the same old pain
Whether you win or you lose isn't gonna change a single thing

I'd pray to God if there was heaven
But heaven seems so very far from here

And it all boils down to the same old thing
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams
And it all boils down to the same old pain
Whether you win or you lose isn't gonna change a single thing
And it all boils down to the same old fear
Just a link in a chain just a puppet on a string
And it all boils down to the same old fear
Whether you win or lose
Whether you win or lose
Whether you win or lose
Whether you win or lose
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve to put me out

I got a job in a steel mill, shucking steel like a slave
Five long years, every Friday I come straight back home with all my pay
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve to put me out

I finally learned my lesson, should a long time ago
The next woman that I marry, she gonna work and bring me the dough
Have you ever been mistreated? You know just what I'm talking about
I worked five long years for one woman, she had the nerve
She had the nerve
She had the nerve
She had the nerve to put me out
Alarm goes off at seven
and you start up-town.
You put in your eight hours
for the powers
that have always been.

'Til it's five-pm...

"Then you go..."

Downtown
Where the folks are broke. You go
Downtown
Where your life's a joke. You go
Downtown
Where you buy a token. You go...
Home to Skid Row.

"Yes you go..."

Downtown
Where the cabs don't stop.

Where the food is slop.
Downtown
Where the hop-heads flop in the snow...
Down on Skid Row.

Uptown you cater to a million jerks.
Uptown you're messengers and mailroom clerks.
Eating all your lunches at the hot-dog carts.
The bosses take your money and they break your hearts.

And Uptown you cater to a million whores.
You disinfect terrazzo on their bathroom floors.
The jobs are really menial you make no bread.
And then at five-o'clock you head

"By subway..."

Downtown
Where the guys are drips.
Downtown
Where they rip your slips.
Downtown
Where relationships are no go.
Down on Skid Row.

Poor, all my life I've always been poor.
I keep askin' God what I'm for.
And he tells me, "Gee, I'm not sure."
"Sweep that floor, kid!"
Oh! I started life as an orphan,
A child of the street, here on Skid
Row! He took me in gave me shelter
A bed, crust of bread and a job.
Treats me like dirt and calls me a slob,
Which I am...
So I live

Downtown
That's your home address, you live
Downtown
When your life's a mess, you live
Downtown
Where depression's just status quo.
Down on Skid Row.

Someone show me a way to get outta here.
'Cause I constantly pray I'll get outta here.
Please won't somebody say I'll get outta here.
Someone gimmie my shot, or I'll rot here!

(Downtown)
Show me how and I will, I'll get outta here.
(There's no rules for us)
(Downtown)
I'll start climbin' up hill and get outta here.
('Cause it's dangerous)

Someone tell me I still could get outta here.
(Where there rainbow just doesn't show)
Someone tell lady luck that I'm stuck here!
(When you get...)

(Downtown)
Gee it sure would be swell to get outta here.
Bid the gutter farewell and get outta here.
I'd move heaven and hell to get outta Skid.
I'd do I don't know what to get outta Skid.
But a hell of a lot to get outta Skid.
People tell me there's not a way outta Skid.
But believe me I gotta get outta Skid
Row!
I woke up this morning my head felt dense
I splashed it with water trying to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen she was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Well it's her way of saying she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin' and I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

In this complicated world it may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cures
Pushed to the limit or standing at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
My baby, he don't talk sweet,
he ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway

And maybe he don't dress fine
But i don't really mind
'cuz every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer:

CHORUS
Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand.
Let's hear it for my baby,
You know you gotta understand.
Oh, maybe he's no Romeo,
But he's my love and one man show.
Whoawhoawhoawhoa
Let's hear it for the boy.

My baby may not be rich,
He's watchin' every dime.
But he loves me loves me loves me,
We always have a real good time.
And maybe he sings off key,
But that's alright by me, yeah.
'Cause what he does he does so well,
Makes me wanna yell.

I just wanna cheer.

This old smoke filled bar is something I'm not used to
But if gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be living
It's not much but I feel welcome here inside

And I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has got a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time

I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
And thanks to you I'm always here till closing time

And I've got swinging doors a jukebox and a barstool
And my new home has got a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time

Yeah, I'm always here at home till closing time
These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned ba-ad

Take a message to Mary but don’t tell ‘er where I am
Take a message to Mary but don’t say I’m in a jam
You can tell her I had to see the world or tell ‘er that my ship set sail
You can say she better not wait for me but don’t tell her I’m in jail
Oh, don’t tell her I’m in jail

Take a message to Mary but don’t tell ‘er what I’ve done
Please don’t mention the stagecoach and the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding day
But please don’t mention my lonely cell where I’m gonna pine away
Until my dying day

Take a message to Mary but don’t tell ‘er all you know
My heart’s achin’ for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu, tell her I’m searchin’ for gold
You can say she better find someone new to cherish and to hold
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold

Ma-ary, Ma-a-a-a-ary
Oh, Lord this cell is cold
'Show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream,' she said
'The one that makes me laugh,' she said
And threw her arms around my head
'Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you...'

Spinning on that dizzy air
I kissed her face and kissed her hair
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
'Why are you so far away?' she said
'Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?'

Soft and only

Lost and lonely

Strange as angels
Sitting in the deepest oceans
Sitting in the water, you're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
I found myself alone
Alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me
If I find him
If I just follow
Would he hold me and never let me go
Would he let me borrow his warm winter coat?
I don't know
I don't know

If I see her
Standing there alone
At the train station three stops from her home
I have half a mind to say what I'm thinking anyway
I don't know
I don't know

There's an airplane in the sky
With a banner right behind
Loneliness is just a crime
Look each other in the eye
And say hello
And say hello
(Ronnie Dunn)

I get out on the redneck side every now and then
Call up my baby she comes over and the party begins
She's a slick nickel she's right on the money
I wouldn't give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

She's got my number, knows my favorite songs on the jukebox
Goes to gettin' down like crazy and the whole place rocks
We'll have a few and get to feelin' right
She'll be my queen bee I'll be her neon knight
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

Oh Oh I love her so
Stand back give her room boys and watch her go

She's a looker, heads turn when she comes through the door
A show stopper when she gets to goin' out on the floor
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

Oh Oh I love her so
Stand back give her room boys and watch her go

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset.
She's going off about something that you said
She doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh
I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know your about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along
So why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me

You belong with me
All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel,all my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I,

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
you don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
From the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much
I do

In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions, didn't know where I was going
'til that day, I found you
how you opened my life to a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart until my dying day

If you're asking do I love you this much
I do, oh, I do
Blue Kentucky highway, headin' for the line
She hadn't said a word all night,
But the wheels are turnin' in her mind
Now I was ridin' shotgun,
And I knew things had gone awry
Just as soon as she dropped me off At the side of the road
And she let that gravel fly

CHORUS
Now I'm walkin' in the moonlight, Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right,
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely As the highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

Was it somethin' that I did to her,
Or the things I never said
I wonder if the way we were was only in my head
Now if I even make it back to town
Before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parking spot around
'Til I find that pick-up truck

CHORUS
Now I'm talkin' in the moonlight
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights I may never see again
She hit me with the left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
And that's about as lonely As a highway's ever been
Stuck here with my thumb out in the wind

Well I'll bet right now she's laughin'
At how she brought me to my knees
But she won't be laughin' half as loud
When she gives me back my keys

CHORUS
She'll be walkin' in the moonlight,
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
And that's a pair of taillights She won't ever see again
She hit me with a left and right
And with nothin' but the taillights
And I know that's about as lonely As a highway's ever been
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

There she goes,
here I come
Let me tell you 'bout a place
Somewhere up-a New-York way
Where the people are so gay
Twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Puttin' trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Here's a man in evenin' clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twistin' the night away-ay
He's dancin' with the chick in slacks
She's a-movin' up and back
Oh man, there ain't nothin' like
Twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Let's twist a while!
Lean up, lean back
Lean up, lean back
Watusi, now fly, now twist
They're twistin' the night away
Here's a fella in bluejeans
Dancin' with a older Queen
Who's dolled up in-a diamond rings and
Twistin' the night away-ay
Man, you oughta see her go
Twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', they're twistin' the night away
One more time!
Lean up, lean back
Lean up, lean back

They're twistin' the night away
Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the morning

Ninety-nine and forty-four one hundreds percent pure love

I wake up with sunshine (sunshine)
Laying beside me
And bluebirds singing right outside my window
Soft warm kisses (kisses)
Say good morning
Then I get breakfast in bed
You know you make me so happy (make me so happy with)

Tell me why? Why must we wait until tonight?
Tell me why? Why must we wait until tonight?

You wanna take a little time.
Wanna drink me like a fine wine.
Write the book of love line by line.
But I want to play with you, ooh...mmmm...right now.
Go all the way with you,baby...and show you how.
'Cause my body just can't say no.
and fingers just won't let go.

Tell me why? Baby. Why must we wait until tonight? Oh, yeah.
Tell me why? Why, when I've waited all my life?
You're touching me, I'm touching you...
Oooh, what should I do? Now tell me why, why must we wait 'till tonight?

You like to take it real slow.
Show me every little move you know.
Take a little love and watch it grow.
But I want to lay with you...darling.
Right now.
Make love all day with you baby.
And show you how...
Take my body, don't take my time.
Take your lips and make them mine.
Aaaaw.

Tell me why? Baby. Why must we wait until tonight? Oh, yeah.
Tell me why? Why, when I've waited all my life?
You're touching me, I'm touching you...

I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

(Chorus)

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

(Repeat Chorus)

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

(Repeat Chorus)

Love and only love
Love and only love
We lie in the dark I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
Oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside 'cause I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice

You lie
You don't want to hurt me
So you lie,
Buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you so you lie
'Til you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie

How long until you just can't go on
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go that's what you wanna do
Oh but you don't know (you don't know)
If it's the right thing to do

So you lie
You don't want to hurt me
So you lie,
Buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do, maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you so you lie
'Til you can find a way to say goodbye
Oh You lie…

You lie…
Oh You lie…
Oh You lie…
Only three stops to make in Alabama
Everyone a one night stand
Workin for a man down South Louisiana
Cause ZZ ain't his only band
Business has been good or bad
But sittin here will drive me mad

(CHORUS)
and I'm gonna get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Get back where they want me
Make a stand
I'm gonna take it like a man

Met a stray woman I think it was in Texas
She was made for those who'd pay
Gotta little drunk and raised a mild ruckus
The city said I could not stay
I guess I'm gonna have to change until this mess is rearranged

(CHORUS)

I guess I'm gonna have to change until my life is rearranged

(Willie Nelson)

Hello walls (hello hello) how things go for you today
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls I'll keep you company.

Hello window (hello hello) well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared
Well look here is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain.

She went away and left us all alone the way she planned
Yes, we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can
Hello ceiling (hello hello) I'm gonna stare at you a while
You know I can't sleep so won't you bear with me awhile.

We must all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long time.
(hello, hello)...
He finally gave into his friend's girlfriend when she said
"There's someone you should meet."
At a crowded restaurant way 'cross town
He waited impatiently

She walked in, their eyes met, and they both stared
And right there and then, everyone else disappeared

But one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly, it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
And for a moment the whole world
Revolved around one boy and one girl

In no time at all they were standing there,
in the front of a little church
Among their friends and family, repeating those sacred words
The preacher said, "Son kiss your bride" and he raised her veil
Like the night they met, time just stood still

For one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly, it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, they knew right away
That this was the day they'd waited for all their lives
For a moment the whole world
Revolved around one boy and one girl

He was holding her hand when the doctor looked up and grinned
"Congratulations. Twins..."

One boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled
And they knew right away
That this was the day they'd waited for all their lives
And for a moment
The whole world revolved around one boy and one girl
Listen to me woman,
I just think it's a sin.
I know you hear me knockin',
but you won't let me in.
Might be fine for you
just to keep me hangin' round.
But if you don't open up this door,
I'm gonna kick it down.


Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes I feel like
there's nowhere to go.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.


Listen,
you've been towing me to shore
for much too long.
But now I'm gonna pull you back
to where you belong.
Might be fine for you
just to keep me hangin' round.
But if you don't open up this door,
I'm gonna kick it down.


Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes I feel like
there's nowhere to go.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes it's the only place that I know,
that I know.


Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes I feel like
there's no place to go.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes it's the only place that I know.


Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes I feel like
there's no place to go.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm back on the streets again.
Sometimes it's the only place that I know.


Only place that I know, yeah.
As long as you love me 

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me(I don't know)
Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from(where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (you love me)
(repeat to fade)
who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (you love me)

Who you are(who you are)
Where you're from
what did you did
as long as you love me

who you are
where you're from(where you're from)
as long as you love me

who you are as long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
as long as you love me
I thought you and me were something special;
Thought you thought that way too.
Now I know that this ol� boy just ain't
The best you think you'll ever do.

It ain't cool to be crazy about you,
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care, like I do.
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart.
I should have known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool
Believe me, it ain't cool.

All of my friends, they tried to tell me
What and what not to do.
It took a while for them to sell me,
But finally they got through.

It ain't cool to be crazy about you,
It ain't suave or debonair
To let you know I care, like I do.
It ain't smart to be so reckless with my heart.
I should have known right from the start
I'd end up like a fool
Believe me, it ain't cool
Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah
Oooh, burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside now yeah...

Yeah...

So many times have I asked you to tell me that I'm your girl
Time after time I have needed a reason just to get inside your world
So many times have I asked you to ask me how it feels to love
And when it's love seems the only conclusion
That I'm guilty of, oh baby, then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning
Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside this love I'm yearning

Mmmm...

And sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder
What I am to you
And sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting
To be part of the things you do
Often I've asked you for too much of your time
I've been stealing
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving
Then I reach out, oh baby, then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning
Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside this love I'm yearning, yearning, yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning...

Oooh, burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah
Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside
Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah
Yeah, yeah...

Baby then you
Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside)
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin' inside yeah, burnin' inside yeah)
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin', burnin', burnin', burnin')

Yearning, burning, yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning, burning, yearning
It's late enough to go drivin'
And see what's mine
Life's the study of dying
And how to do it right
If you're a holy roller
If you're bent on the loose
If you're hanging around
I'm holdin' the noose

Come a little bit closer
And get untied
In a hearse rollin over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it

Come on, let's go drivin'
Come on, let's take a little ride
Life's the study of dying
And how to do it right
Falling in love again
Never wanted to,
What am I to do?
Can't help it.

Love's always been my game,
Play it how I may
I was made that way
Can't help it.

Girls cluster to me
Like moths around a flame,
And if their wings burn
I know I'm not to blame

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
Can't help it

Girls cluster to me
Like moths around the flame
And if their wings burn
I know I'm not to blame

Falling in love again
Never wanted to
What am I to do?
Can't help it
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
and I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
and I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
and I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes...

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun,
and I say it's all right
It's all right

She makes his coffee, she makes his bed
She does the laundry, she keeps him fed
When she was twenty-one she wore her mother's lace
She said &amp;amp;quot;forever&amp;amp;quot; with a smile upon her face
She does the car-pool, she PTAs
Doctors and dentists, she drives all day
When she was twenty-nine she delivered number three
And every Christmas card showed a perfect family
Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines. He thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you change your mind. He thinks he'll keep her
She packs his suitcase, she sits and waits
With no expression upon her face
When she was thirty-six she met him at their door
She said I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore
Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines. He thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you change your mind. He thinks he'll keep her
For fifteen years she had a job and not one raise in pay
Now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage
Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines. He thinks he'll keep her
Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
At least until you change your mind. He thinks he'll keep her
I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

Don't know why
I have to drive so fast
My car has nothing to prove
It's not new
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2.

Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

Can't be late
I leave plenty of time
Shaking hands with the clock
I can't stop
I'm on a roll and I'm ready to rock.

Oh I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I hear a voice
That say's I'm running behind
I better pick up my pace
It's a race
And there ain't no room
For someone in second place.

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I'm in a hurry to get things done

I'm in a hurry to get things done
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun
All I really gotta do is live and die
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why...
Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now
What she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad.
Yeah, I live for little moments like that.

That's like, just last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was going off
She was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh.
Yeah, I live for little moments like that.

I know she's not perfect
But she tries so hard for me
And I thank God that she isn't
'Cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections
It's the sudden change of plans
When she misreads the directions
And we're lost but holding hands.
Yeah, I live for little moments like that.

--- Instrumental ---

When she's laying on my shoulder
On the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep
So does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it
Because it's tingling and it's numb
She looks so much like an angel
That I don't want to wake her up.
Yeah, I live for little moments.

When she steals my heart again
And doesn't even know it.
Yeah, I live for little moments like that...

Well
Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
Let's all go, down to Dumas Walker
We'll get a slaw, burger, fries and a bottle of ski
Bring it on out to my baby and me

Yeah we're headed to the drive-in on a Saturday night
Just me and my baby and a six-pack of Lite
Got a pocketful of money and I'm rarin' to go
Down to Dumas Walker right after the show
They'll be shootin marbles in the back of the store
And laying money down on the floor

(Repeat chorus)

He takes all his orders down one at a time
Don't need a pad he's got a photogenic mind
He don't like the young folks hanging around
He's here to let ya know we got a law in this town
You oughta see him reelin' when he walks through the door
The marble king is ready for more

(Repeat chorus)
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town,
Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: &amp;amp;quot;Don't stop.&amp;amp;quot;
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)
Rain dripping off the brim of my hat
it sure is cold today
and here I am'a walking down sixty-six
Wish she hadn't done me that way

Sleeping under a table at a road side park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin in our king size bed

Chorus
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Pheonix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her

Wind whipping down the neck of my shirt
Like I aint got nothing on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
than what I've been fighting at home

Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
People writing letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll still be just as gone

Chorus
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Pheonix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her

Anyplace is alright as long as I
forget i've ever known her

whistle to fade
Well I don't look good in no Armani suits,
No Gucci shoes - or designer boots,
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z,
But there's just one thing that looks good on me.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

I'm not satisfied with Versace style,
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file,
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good,
But there's only one thing that fits like it should.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

Yeah it's you - it could only be you,
Nobody else will ever do,
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to,
Ya we stick like glue.

The only thing I want,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.

The only thing I want - Yeah,
The only thing I need,
The only thing I choose,
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you.
Driving through town just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
Till his nuggets were gone
Green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my breaks and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with "s" and I was concerned
So I said son now now where did you learn to talk like that

[Chorus one]

He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said lord please help me help my stupid self
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to god like he was talking to a friend
And I said son now where'd you learn to pray like that

[Chorus two]

He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you

[Bridge]

With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said my little bear is growing up
He said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do

[Chorus three]

Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be as strong as superman
We'll be just alike, hey won't we dad
When I can do everything you do
Cause I've been watching you
I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winemaca road
When along came a semi with high and canvas covered load
If you're going to Winemaca Mack with me you can ride
So I climed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I seen a road with so much dust and sand
Then I said listen bud I've traveled every road in this here land

I've been everywhere man I've ben everywhere man
Cross the deserts bare man I've breathed the mountain air man
Of travel I've had my share man I've been everywhere

(I know some place you haven't been) I've been everywhere
Nine planets round the sun
Only one does the sun embrace
Upon this watered one
So much we take for granted
So let us sleep outside tonight
Lay down in our mothers arms
For here we can rest safely
If green should slip to grey
But our hearts still bloody be
And if mountains crumble away
And the river dry would it stop the stepping feet
Take all that we can get
When its done
Nobody left to bury here
Nobody left to dig the holes
And here we can rest safely
One sweet world
Around a star is spinning
One sweet world
And in her breath Im swimming
And here we will rest in peace
My baby, he don't talk sweet,
he ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway

And maybe he don't dress fine
But i don't really mind
'cuz every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer:

CHORUS
Let's hear it for the boy
Oh, let's give the boy a hand.
Let's hear it for my baby,
You know you gotta understand.
Oh, maybe he's no Romeo,
But he's my love and one man show.
Whoawhoawhoawhoa
Let's hear it for the boy.

My baby may not be rich,
He's watchin' every dime.
But he loves me loves me loves me,
We always have a real good time.
And maybe he sings off key,
But that's alright by me, yeah.
'Cause what he does he does so well,
Makes me wanna yell.
(CHORUS)

'Cause every time he pulls me near,
I just wanna cheer.
(CHORUS)

(Let's hear it for the boy)
Let's hear it for my man

Whoa let's hear it for my boy
(Let's hear it for the boy)
Let's hear it for my man
(Let's hear it for my babe)
She's so kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
She's a mouthful of anything and everything a man could want
She ain't typical, she's unpredictable, she's available, it's a miracle
How my heart stumbled into someone so kissable, huggable, lovable,
unbelievable

Up 'til now my life has been so lonely and boring
I never thought I would find someone so

Elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring
She's so beautiful, it's indisputable, it's undeniable, she's
got-to-havable
She's music to my ears, and makes my heart sing, so kissable,
huggable, lovable, unbelievable

There's so many things
I want to tell her
Like I love her
But every time I talk
I start to stutter

She's so elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring
She's so beautiful, it's indisputable, it's undeniable, she's
got-to-havable
She's music to my ears, and makes my heart sing, so kissable,
huggable, lovable, unbelievable

Kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
Kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song.

You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song.

Chorus:
January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flames became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here.

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write.

--- Instrumental ---

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much to sad to write.

Much too sad to write...
If I could grant you one wish
I wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you baby
When you're driving me, ooh, crazy

chorus:
Ooh, I love the way you, love the way you love me
There's no where else I'd rather be
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Love me, ooh, the way you love me

It's not right, it's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you

(Chorus)

You're the million reasons why there's
Love reflecting in my eyes

(chorus til fade)
With music by our side

To break the color lines

Let's work together

To improve our way of life

Join voices in protest

To social injustice

A generation full of courage

Come forth with me



Chorus:

People of the world today

Are we looking for a better way of life

We are a part of the rhythm nation

People of the world unite

Strength in numbers we can get it right

One time

We are a part of the rhythm nation



This is the test

No struggle no progress

Lend a hand to help

Your brother do his best

Things are getting worse

We have to make them better

It's time to give a damn

Let's work together come on

Now, I don't want to lose you, but I don't want to use you
just to have somebody by my side.
And I don't want to hate you,
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry.

And that don't really matter to anyone anymore.
But like a fool I keep losing my place
and I keep seeing you walk through that door.

(Chorus)

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much,
and it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust.
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are.
Baby, sometimes, love just aint enough.

Now, I could never change you, I don't want to blame you.
Baby, you don't have to take the fall.
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you.
Maybe I just want to have it all.

It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain.
And like a fool who will never see the truth,
I keep thinking something's gonna change.

(Chorus)

And there's no way home, when it's late at night and you're all alone.
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed,
there beside you, where I used to lay?

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much,
and it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch.
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are.
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough.

Baby, sometimes, love... it just ain't enough.
Oh, Oh, Oh, No.
Under an old brass paper weight,
is my list of things to do today:
Go to the bank and the hardware store,
put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
but when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
take a deep breath of mountain air
put on my glove and play some catch
it's time that i make time for that
wade the shore, cast a line,
look up an old lost friend of mine
sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
cuttin' the grass just had to wait
cause i've got more important things
like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow, what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
take a deep breath of mountain air
put on my glove and play some catch
it's time that i make time for that
wade the shore, cast a line,
look up an old lost friend of mine
sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Raise a little hell, laugh till it hurts,
Put an extra five in the plate at church,
call up my folks just to chat,
it's time that i make time for that
stay up late, and over sleep
show her what she means to me
catch up on all the things i've always missed
just start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my List of things to do today.
We were all down at Margie's bar
Telling stories if we had one
Someone fired the old jukebox up
The song sure was a sad one
A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose
From the pain the song was inflicting
And all at once he jumped to his feet
Just like somebody kicked him

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box last night

Bubba ain't never been accused of being mentality stable
So we did not draw an easy breathe
Until he laid that colt on the table
He hung his head till the cops showed up
They dragged him right out of Margie's
Told him "Don't play dumb with us, son"
"Know damn well what the charge is."

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry


Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box last night

Well, the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on
The confrontation was a tense one
Shook his head said, "Bubba Boy,"
"You was always a dense one."
Reckless discharge of a gun
That's what the officers are claiming
Bubba hollered, "Reckless! Hell!"
"I shot just where I was aiming."

Bubba shot the juke box last night
Said it played a sad song it made him cry
Went to his truck and got a forty five
Bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night
Well he could not tell right from wrong
Through the teardrops in his eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
It was justifiable homicide
Bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot
Bubba shot the jukebox last night
I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
(chorus)
The girls all get prettier at closing time
They all begin to look like movie stars
The girls all get prettier at closing time
When the change starts taking place
It puts a glow on every face
Of the falling angels of the back street bars

(verse 1)
If I could rate'em on a scale from 1 to 10
I'm lookin' for a 9 but 8 would slip right in
A few more drinks and I might slip to a 5 or even a 4
But when tomorrow morning comes, and I wake up with a number 1
I sware I'll never do it anymore

(verse 2)
Now I don't mean to criticize the girls at all
Cause I know Robert Redford even overhauls
We all picture in our minds a girl that looks just right
Ain't it funny, ain't it strange, how a man's opinion changes
When he starts to face that lonely night
Six lanes, tail lights
Red ants marching into the night
Disappear to the left and right again
Another supper from a sack
A 99-cent heart attack
I've got a pounding head and an achin back
And the camels buried in the big straw stack

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the West
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

Well I'm from a map dot
A stop sign on a black top
Caught the first bus I could hop from there
But all of this glitter is getting dark
There's concrete growin in the city park
I don't know who my neighbors are
There's bars on the corners and bars on my heart

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Where the green grass grows

I'm gonna live where the green grass grows
Watch my corn pop up in rows
Every night be tucked in close to you
Raise our kids where the good Lord's blessed
Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows
Oh, where the green grass grows
Blue lights flashing in my rearview
The sheriff said, boy I should have known it was you
You got fourteen people in the back of this truck
I warned you twice now I'm writing you up
I said officer what have I done
He smiled and said boy your having too much fun

Too much fun, what's that mean
I like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say I've done
Well, I ain't never had too much fun

There was a fight Friday night at the Stumble Inn
Me and ol' Harley just had to join in
Next thing you know we were both seeing stars
They threw us out and closed down the bar
I said the Long Branch is open, the night's still young
And we ain't never had too much fun

Too much fun, what's that mean
I like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say I've done
Well, I ain't never had too much fun

I'm a holly terror, a tornado
Wind me up, turn me loose, and let me go

Too much fun, what's that mean
I like too much money, there's no such thing
It's like a girl too pretty with too much class
Being too lucky, a car too fast
No matter what they say I've done
Well, I ain't never had too much fun

No matter what they say I've done
We'll we ain't never had too much fun
Give me the reins and let me run
'Cause I ain't never had too much fun
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that
She'd be discovered someday.

So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them
As she brought them to their feet.

Chorus:
She was a big star
At Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
She was a big star.

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place.

She signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers.

Chorus:
She was a big star
At Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
She was a big star.

She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they are
And where she is now.

Her old neighbors swear they're certain
she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going
Less you got somethin they ain't got.

So she sings tonight
To 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us.

She's a big star
As she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard
To get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
She's a big star.
She's a big star...
Everything I Own

You sheltered me from harm.
You kept me warm
You kept me warm
And you gave my life to me
You set me free,
You set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.

You taught me how to cry
I don't know why, just don't know why
You told those lies to me
You set me free, set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.
Just to hold you once again.

If there's someone you know,
That wont let you go,
And is taking it all for granted.
You may lose them one day,
Someone takes them away,
And you don't hear a word they say

I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.

Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him.

I don't wanna play house; I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house; It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said good-bye.

I don't wanna play house; I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house; It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said good-bye.
It's no secret; somebody waits at home for you,
And I know how hard it seems for you to do.
So if you really believe this love is so wrong,
We don't have to carry on.
But still I wonder:
Why does it have to be wrong or right?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
Won't somebody please, please tell me.
Why does it have to be black or white?
Why do we have to hurt one to love another?
Oh, tell me why?
Why does it have to be?

Can't say that you didn't know where this might lead.
And I know I couldn't have been that hard to read.
But we both know this is not where you belong.
There's no need to carry on,
Ah, but I can't help but wonder:

Why does it have to be wrong or right?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
Won't somebody please, please tell me.
Why does it have to be black or white?
Why do we have to hurt one to love another?
Oh, tell me why?
Why does it have to be?

Why does it have to be wrong or right?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
(Won't somebody please.)
Won't somebody please, please tell me.
Why does it have to be black or white?
Why do we have to hurt one to love another?
(Oh, tell me.)
(Oh, tell me.)
Oh, tell me why?

Oh, tell me why does it have to be wrong or right?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
Won't somebody please, please tell me.
Why does it have to be black or white?
Why do we have to hurt one to love another?
(Oh, tell me.)
Oh, tell me why?

To Fade.

(Oh, tell me.)
Why does it have to be wrong or right?
Why does it have to be one way or the other?
Won't somebody please, please tell me.
Why does it have to be black or white?
Why do we have to hurt one to love another?
Yes, she blew through the door like TNT,
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me.
Said I'm a whiskey drinkin', cowboy chasin', helluva time.
I like Kenny, Keith, Alan and Patsy Cline.
I'm a full grown Queen Bee lookin' for honey.
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country,

Yeah, the band took a break,
The DJ played P Diddy.
She said I didn't come here to hear,
Somethin' thumpin' from the city.
Said I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money.
Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country.

Crank up the band, play the steel guitar.
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar.
Threw back a shot yelled I'm a George Strait junkie.
Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play somethin' country.

Yeah, the bartender yelled y'all, it's closin' time.
She got this wild look on her face,
An' said your truck or mine,
I know a place down the road,
It's kinda funky.
Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country.
Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play somethin' country.

Crank up the band, play the steel guitar.
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar.
Threw back a shot yelled I'm a George Strait junkie.
Ah-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play somethin' country.

Instrumental break.

Crank up the band, play the steel guitar.
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar.
Threw back a shot; yelled I'm a George Strait junkie.
Ah-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
Ha-ooh-hoo, play somethin' country.
I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're giving me is conscience, I guess
If I were walking in your shoes I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying about me, I'm having lots of fun

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitare 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitare 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitare 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do
Don't tell me I've nothing to do

I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, I'm in the mood for love
I said night time is the right time, to be with the one you love
You know when night come baby, God know, you're so far away
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood, baby, in the mood for love
I said yes, my mama told me, to leave that girl alone
But my mama didn't know, God know, girl was puttin' down
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, in the mood for love
People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like him and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
The sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

Love a guy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind, better take him home
Yeah, and don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything's gonna be all right
Our paths may never cross again
Maybe my heart will never mend
But I'm glad for all the good times
'Cause you brought me so much sunshine
Love was the best it's ever been.

Chorus:
I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed loving you girl
You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile
I wouldn't trade one memory,
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

They say that all good things must end
Love comes and goes just like the wind
You've got your dreeams to follow
But if I had the chance tomorrow
You know I'd do it all again.

Chorus:
I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed loving you girl
You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile
I wouldn't trade one memory,
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

Oh I wouldn't trade one memory,
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl,
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

Chorus:
I wouldn't have missed it for the world
Wouldn't have missed loving you girl
You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile
I wouldn't trade one memory,
'Cause you mean too much to me
Even though I lost you girl
I wouldn't have missed it for the world...
[Chorus]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man,
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can.
And when it's time for leavin',
I hope you'll understand,
That I was born a ramblin' man.

Well my father was a gambler down in Georgia,
He wound up on the wrong end of a gun.
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down highway 41.

CHORUS

I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin',
Leaving out of Nashville, Tennessee,
They're always having a good time down on the bayou,
Lord, them Delta women think the world of me.

CHORUS

[Repeat and Fade]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man...
(1st Verse)
Wasted days and wasted nights,
I have left for you Behind
for you don't belong to me,
your heart belongs to someone else.

(2nd Verse)
Why should I keep loving you,
when I know that you're Not true?
And why should I call your name,
when you're to blame
for making me Blue?

(chorus)
Don't you remember the day,
that you went away and left me?
I was so lonely,
prayed for you only,
my love.

(Chorus)

(1st Verse)

(2nd Verse)
Well I was sitting in a roadhouse down on Highway 41
you were wipin� off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missin� her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee, but I couldn't see a thing
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

(Chorus)
I'm in love with you baby , I don't even know your name
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
So maybe its just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date, and then I asked to tie knot
I got a little wasted ya I went a little far
I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say: I'm in love with you baby
and I don't even know your name

(Chorus)

The next thing I remembered I was hearing weddin� bells
Standing by a woman in a long white lacy vail
I raised the vail she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the hell am I? And just who the hell are you?
She said I was your waitress and our last name�s now the same
Cause I'm married to you baby, and I don't even know your name

Yah I'm married to a waitress I don't even know her name
I've never been too good with all those sexual games
I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
Hey I'm married to a waitress and I don't even know her name

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I needed the shelter of someone's arms, there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs,
there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop (stop)and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop (stop) and thank you baby
I just want to stop (stop) and thank you baby

This time is special for you
I don't think you ever fell for someone like i do
Every now and then I think of you
But this time is time for rock on

Hey do you remeber the time I took you after class
I think you were going to find something special of me
But then when you turned around you broke my heart like a glass
I think you should never be like that to someone like me

This time i will let you down
This time i will never give you to
This time I will set you free
And only tonight you will be mine

Every now and then I think about you
and this pain is making me feel so
alive is the word but I think better off
wothout you i would be

I damn you my sweet blue eye darlin'
i couldn't stop siking for you
even if you never let me be
the man you wanted to see

Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now,
But it seems now, that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away.

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doin fine
I heard you told him,
That you'd love him till the end of time
Now, that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away.

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know, when I'll be back in town
But remember, what I tell you
In time your gonna pay
And it's surprising, how time slips away...

Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees

Love is in the air

In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon,
keep shining bright.
Blue moon, keep on shining bright,
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight,
Blue moon, keep shining bright.

I said blue moon of Kentucky
keep on shining,
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.

Stars shining bright,

Blue moon of Kentucky

Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.
When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing to love on you
Well, I can feel the heat from across the room
Aint it wild what a little flame
Can make you wanna do

(Chorus)
I melt everytime you look at me that way
It never fails, anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, everytime
Whats even better
Is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

(Repeat Chorus Twice)

Evertime you look at me that way
I melt, I melt
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number troubles by the score
Every day you love me less each day I love you more
Yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
[ steel ]
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you was coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches...
Friday finally came around
This girl's ready to paint the town
Tonight ain't nothin' gonna slow me down

I did my time workin' all week
Tonight's all mine, tomorrow I'll sleep
I wanna hear a band with a country sound

Well, I've been couped up all week long
I've been workin' my fingers to the bone

(Chorus)

Well, it's a girl's night out
Honey, there ain't no doubt
I'm gonna dance every dance 'til the boys go home
Well, it's my night to rock
No watchin' that ol' clock
Oh, ain't no doubt, Lordy it's a girl's night out

Two step or the Cotton Eye Joe
They can play 'em fast or they can play 'em slow
I can do 'em all just show me the floor
You can give me a little rock 'n roll
Or even a waltz with the lights down low
I'll still be dancin' when they close the door

If I don't see you through the week
See you through the window
See you next time that we're talking on the telephone
And if I don't see you in that Indian summer
Then I want to see you further on up the road

I said, oh won't you come back?
I have to see you my dear
Want you come back in the Celtic New Year?
In the Celtic New Year

If I don't see you when I'm going down Louisiana
If I don't see you when I'm down on Bourbon Street
If you don't see me when I'm singing Jack of Diamonds
If you don't see me when I'm on my lucky streak

Woa, I want you, want you to come on back
I've made it very clear
I want you to come back home in the Celtic New Year
Celtic New Year

If I don't see you when the bonfires are burning, burning
If I don't see you when we're singing the Gloriana tune
If I've got to see you when it's raining deep inside the forest
I got to see you at the waning of the moon

Said oh, won't you come on back?
Want you to be of good cheer
Come back home on the Celtic New Year

Celtic New Year, Celtic New Year
Celtic New Year

Come on home, come on home, come on home, come on home
Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door
Yeah, the freeway's standing still today
It's gonna make me late, and thats for sure
I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine

Chorus:
There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more

Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up
I could work my life away, but why?
I got things to do before die

Repeat Chorus

Some believe in destiny, and some believe in fate
I believe that happiness is something we create
You best belive that I'm not gonna wait
'Cause there's gotta be something more

I get home 7:30 the house is dirt, but it can wait
Yeah, 'cause right now I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Armageddon could be knocking at my door
but I ain't gonna answer thats for sure.
There's gotta be something more!
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
Wake up, little Susie, wake up
We’ve both been sound asleep, wake up, little Susie, and weep
The movie’s over, it’s four o’clock, and we’re in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie

Whatta we gonna tell your mama
Whatta we gonna tell your pa
Whatta we gonna tell our friends when they say “ooh-la-la?

They kissed goodbye at the terminal gate
She said, "You're gonna be late if you don't go"
He held her tight, said, "I'll be alright
I'll call you tonight to let you know"
He bought a postcard, on the front it just said Heaven
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, "Hello", I miss you so, wish you were here

She got a call that night but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, ma'am the plane went down
Our crews have searched the ground
No survivors found she heard him say
But somehow she got a postcard in the mail
That just said Heaven with a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loves and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, "Hello" I miss you so, wish you were here

The weather's nice, in paradise
It's summertime all year and all the folks we know
They say, "Hello" I miss you so, wish you were here
Wish you were here

There's songs and poems and promises
And dreams that might come true
But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin', how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's
Made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing
Little things that turn me on
Like standing in the kitchen
In your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers
I still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

When a whole lot of Decembers
Are showin' in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place
You'll be just as lovely and I'll still be around
And if I can't I know that
I'd still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
A woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I'd love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around
Oh, darlin' how I love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper
Pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things
My woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means
Just havin' you around...
She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep.
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there.

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in Paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you, you and me in Paradise

Just think about it.

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying.

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in Paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you, you and me in Paradise

Just think about it

Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from everyplace
Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in Paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you, you and me in Paradise

Just think about it.

Think about it.

It's just another day, for you and me, in Paradise
It's just another day, for you and me, in Paradise
Paradise
Just think about it
Paradise
Just think about
Paradise

CAPO: 2nd Fret/KEY: E/PLAY: D
[A7] Today I [D] passed you [A7] on the [D] street
[D7] And my [G] heart fell at your [D] feet
I Can't [A7] Help It If I'm Still In Love With [D] You
[A7] Somebody [D] else stood [A7] by your [D] side
[D7] And he [G] looked so satis-[D] fied
I Can't [A7] Help It If I'm Still In Love With [D] You. ... [D7]

A [G] picture from the past came slowly [D] stealing
As I [A7] brushed your arm and walked so close to [D] you ... [D7]
Then [G] suddenly I got that old time [D] feeling
I Can't [A] Help It If I'm Still In Love With [D] You.

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh, heaven only knows how much I miss you
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You.
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said "Honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
(INSTRUMENTAL BREAK)
Well I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
EVERYBODY!
I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
(SPOKEN)
(Pause)
What?!?!
(Pause)
You guys... already know what's comin', don't ya?
And ya know what... you're right.


You're exactly right. What would a Garth Live album
be without the live version of Friends In Low Places?
Because it's only here where you can find that
mysterious third verse that goes on the end of that
song. But, does anybody know the words to that
verse? That's what I wanna know.
Well, in that case I think the friends in low places
should sing that third verse.
This outta be good.
Alright, here we go...
(SUNG BY CROWD)
Well I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then I've been there before
Everything's alright
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just wait till I finish this glass
And sweet little lady
I'll head back to the bar
GIVE IT TO ME!!!
And you can kiss my ass!

Honey, I've got friends in low places...
I can hear the neighbors
They're arguin' again
And there hasn't been peace on our street
Since who knows when
I don't mean to listen in
But the shoutin' is so loud
I turn up the radio to drown it out
And silently I say a little prayer

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy
Heaven only knows how I've been blessed
With the gift of you love
And I look around and all I see
Is your happiness embracing me
Oh Lord I'd be lost
But for the grace of God

I can see that old man
He's walking past our door
And I've been told that he's rich
But he seems so poor
'Cause no one comes to call on him
And his phone it never rings


He wanders through his empty home
Surrounnded by his things
And silently I say a little prayer, yes I do

But for the grace of God go I
I must've been born a lucky guy

Oh Lord I'd be lost

May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart
Bless Your name, bless Your name, Jesus
And the deeds of the day and the truth in my ways
Speak of You, speak of You, Jesus

For this is what I'm glad to do
It's time to live a life of love that pleases You
And I will give my all to You
Surrender everything I have and follow You
I'll follow You

Lord, will You be my vision, Lord, will You be my guide
Be my hope, be my light and the way
And I'll look not for riches, nor praises on earth
Only You'll be the first of my heart

I will follow
I will follow
I will follow You
Satin sheets to lie on, satin pillows to cry on
Still, I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillac, tailor-mades upon my back
Still, I want you to set me free

I've found another man who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight like he does on a long, long night
No, you didn't keep me satisfied

Drinkin' was forbidden
In my Christian country home
I learned to play the flattop
On them good ol' Gospel songs
Then I heard about the barrooms
Just across the Georgia line
Where a boy could make a livin'
Playin' guitar late at night.

Had to learn about the ladies;
Too young to understand
Why the young girls fall in love
With the boys in the band
When the boys turn to music,
The girls just turn away
To some other guitar picker
In some other late night place.

Yeah, I held on to my music;
I let the ladies walk away
Took my songs and dreams to Nashville
Then I moved on to L.A.
Up to New York City,
All across the USA
I lost so much of me
But there's enough of me to say, that my..

Chorus:
Home's in Alabama,
No matter where I lay my head
My home's in Alabama,
Southern born and Southern bred.

What keeps me goin'
I don't really know
Can't be the money
Lord knows I'm always broke
Could it be the satisfaction
Of bein' understood
When the people really love ya
And let you know when it's good

Oh I'll speak my Southern English
Just as natural as I please
I'm in the heart of Dixie,
Dixie's in the heart of me
And someday when I make it,
When love finds a way
Somewhere high on Lookout Mountain
I'll just smile with pride and say, that my

I want to live
I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood,
I've been to Redwood
I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind
It's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Keep me searching and I'm growing old
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
You look so disbelieving
At my suitcase by the door
My taxi's on its' way
I can't take it anymore

Lately you've forgotten
What loving me is about
Well, now you've got five minutes
To figure it out

CHORUS
You've got five minutes
To tell me what I've needed to hear
You've got five minutes
To show me that your really sincere
That's not much time to change my mind
It'll take a miracle no doubt
And you've got five minutes
To figure it out

Now I've got your attention
Here's what I've got to say
You'd better do some talking
'Cause my taxi's on its' way

We used to set the nights on fire
Now everyday is the same
But now you've got five minutes
To kindle the flame

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
You can start with please don't leave me
And end with I love you
And if you'd only kiss me
The way you used to do
You could see a miracle come true

REPEAT CHORUS

TAG
You've still got five minutes
To figure it out
Wanna tell you a story,
About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday,
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said that don't confront me,
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent,
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady,
I said, "You let me slide?"
I'll have the rent for you tomorrow
Or the next day I don't know
So said let me slide it on you know people,
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me,
But for five year she was so nice
Lord she was lovey-dovey,
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?",
I said, "No, can't find no job,
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent"
She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"
Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner,
Leaning up against a post"
I said "But I'm tired, I've been walkin' all day"
She said "That don't confront me,
Long as I get my money next Friday"
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent,
And out the door I went

So I go down the streets,
Down to my good friend's house
I said "Look man I'm outdoors you know,
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?"
He said "Uh, let me go and ask my wife"
He come out of the house,
I could see it in his face
I know that was no
He said "I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, you know"
I said "I know, everybody funny, now you funny too"
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent
She said "Yeah?" I said "Oh yeah"
And then she was so nice,
Lord, she was lovey-dovey
So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go,
I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go
She a-howlin' about the front rent, she'll be lucky to get any back rent,
She ain't gonna get none of it
So I stop in the local bar you know people,
I go to the bar, I ring my coat, I call the bartender
Said "Look man, come down here", he got down there
So what you want?

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Well I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when,
I've been drinking bourbon, whiskey, scotch and gin
Gonna get high man, I'm gonna get loose,
Need me a triple shot of that juice
Gonna get drunk, don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

But I'm sitting now at the bar,
I'm getting drunk, I'm feelin' mellow
I'm drinkin' bourbon, I'm drinkin' scotch, I'm drinkin' beer
Looked down the bar, here come the bartender
I said "Look man, come down here"
So what you want?

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since the night before last,
Gotta get a drink man, I'm gonna get gassed
Gonna get high man, I ain't had enough,
Need me a triple shot of that stuff
Gonna get drunk, won't you listen right here,
I want one bourbon, one shot and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

Now by this time I'm plenty high,
You know when your mouth a-getting dry you're plenty high
Looked down the bar I say to my bartender
I said "Look man, come down here", he got down there
So what you want this time?
I said "Look man, a-what time is it?"
He said "The clock on the wall say three o'clock.
Last call for alcohol, so what you need?"

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since a nigh' on a week,
Gotta get drunk man, so I can't even speak
Gonna get high man, listen to me,
One drink ain't enough Jack, you better make it three
I wanna get drunk, I'm gonna make it real clear,
I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound

And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of the trees

Love is in the air

In the thunder of the sea

And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

CHORUS

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Oh oh oh

Love is in the air
In the rising of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done

And I don't know if you're an illusion
Don't know if I see it true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe inr

And it's there when I look in your eyes

CHORUS (4x)
I look for trouble and i found it son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but i don't think i can
You make one move and you're a dead man friend
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?

He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
And left me reeling on a steel reel rack
They got'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?

Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives
Son of a carhop and some all night dives
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All i remember was a drunk man's breath
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?

You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Don't let them take you to the man down town
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?

I live with Angel she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but i don't know how
I'm at the bottom in the jailhouse now
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?

You know the story about the jailhouse rock
Don't want to do it but just don't get caught
They got'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can i baby?
Welcome to my world.

After eight long hours of working in the factory
His legs was tired as he walked out through the door.
His hands was dirty and his head was aching,
He said: &amp;amp;quot;It's like a sickness but I think I know a cure&amp;amp;quot;

It's Friday night, the time is right,
My mind is set I'm going out tonight.
I'm gonna dance 'till I can't dance no more,
Swinging my feet out on the floor.

After spending fiftteen hours in our tour buss,
After we've been sleeping on some madras on the floor.
After we've been playing in front of a crowd of twenty morons,
It's nice to know that life can offer something more.

‘Cause I’m keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your face - always

I’m keeping you forever and for always
I’m in your arms
Looks like we made it
Look how far we’ve come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we’d get there someday

They said, “I bet they‘ll never make it”
But just look at us holding on
We’re still together still going strong

(You‘re still the one)
You’re still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You’re still the one I want for life
(You‘re still the one)
You’re still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You’re still the one I kiss good night

Ain’t nothin’ better
We beat the odds together
I’m glad we didn’t listen
Look at what we would be missin’
They said, “I bet they‘ll never make it”
But just look at us holdin’ on
We’re still together still goin’ strong

(You‘re still the one)
You’re still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You’re still the one I want for life
(You‘re still the one)
You’re still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You’re still the one I kiss good night

(You‘re still the one)
You’re still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You’re still the one I want for life
(You‘re still the one)
You’re still the one I love
The only one I dream of
You’re still the one I kiss good night

I’m so glad we made it
Look how far we’ve come my baby
I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you, I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me
Ain't goin' down, big road by myself
Ain't goin' down, big road by myself
And if I can't take you baby, I'm gonna take somebody else

I would take you baby, if you wanna go
On a cloud trip you baby, if you wanna go
If you don't wanna go baby, I'm a take somebody else

I ain't gonna walk, I ain't gonna walk by myself
I declare I ain't walk baby, I ain't gonna walk by myself
I'm gonna take somebody baby
Gonna take somebody right now

In the sun tryin' to find somebody else
I walked all night long; I declare I walked all night long
Tryin' to find somebody else
Who gone, go down, the big road with me
Come on, if you wanna go
Ooooh yeah come on right now, baby
If you wanna go baby,
Coz I ain't goin' down the big road by myself
What the hell is wrong with you tonight,
I cant seem to say or do the right thing,
Wanted to be sure your feeling right,
Wanted to be sure we want the same thing.

She said,
I can't believe it,
You can't,
Possibly mean it,
Don't we,
All want the same thing,
Don't we,
Well who said anything about love.....

No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls,
You're all the same.

Mama always told me save yourself,
Take a little time and find the right girl,
Then again don't end up on the shelf,
Logical advice gets you in a whirl.

I know,
A lot of things that,
You don't,
You wanna here some,
She said,
Just give me something,
Anything,
Well give me all you got without love,

No, not love she said,
Don't you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
No, not love she said,
Don't you know that it's different for girls,
You're all the same..........

Who said anything about love.........

No, not love she said,
Don't you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls X2

Your all the same (repeat X4, fading out)
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal
Mill worker houses lined up in a row,
another southern sunday morning blow
Beneath the steeple all the people have begun
shakin' hands with the man who grips the gospel gun
While the quiet prayer, the smell of dinner on the ground
heals up the morning air, ain't nothin' sweeter around

I can almost hear my mama pray:
"Oh lord forgive us when we doubt,"
another sacred sunday in the south

A ragged rebel flag flies high above it all
popping in the wind like an angry cannon ball
The holes of history are cold and still,
but they smell the powder burnin' and they probably always will

And on the old town square under the barber shop pole,
they sat me up in the chair when I was four years old

I can almost hear my papa say:
"Won't you hold still son, stop squirmn' around
another sacred sundays coming down"

(Instrumental break)

I can almost hear the old folks say:
"You'll make it big one day, you'll leave this town,"
Some other lazy sunday you'll come back around

(Instrumental break)

I can feel the evening sun go down,
and all the lights in the houses one by one go out
Softly in the distance nothing stirs about
and the night is filled with the sound of a whipporwil

On a sunday in the south
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on
The sound turned down
And a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I
On the walls around me
The way that it was
And could've been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away.

I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with my pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry.

Would it help if I turned
The sad song on
All by myself
Would sure hit me hard
Now that your gone
Or maybe unfold
Some old yellow lost love letters
Its gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you
By hiding this way.

'Cause', I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with my pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry.

Well, I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with this pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry...
I'm standing at the crossroads in life, and I don't know where to go.
You know you've got my heart babe, but my music's got my soul.
Let me play it one more time, I'll tell the truth and make it rhyme,
And hope they understand me.

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog,
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake,
Feed Jake


Now Broadway's like a sewer, bums and hookers everywhere.
Whino's passed out on the side walk, doesn't anybody care.
Some say he's worthless, just let him be.
But I for one would have to disagree.
And so would their mama.


Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog,
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake,
Feed Jake


If you get an ear pierced, some will call you gay.
But if you drive a pick-up, they'll say 'No, he must be straight.'
What we are and what we ain't, what we can and what we can't,
Does it really matter?


Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake, feed Jake, he's been a good dog,
My best friend right through it all, if I die before I wake,
Feed Jake
Out among the stars I sail
way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sail
A dream that ended too soon
Now I know exactly who I am
and what I'm here for
and I will go sailing no more

All the things I thought I'd be
All the brave things I've done
vanish like a snowflake
with the rising of the sun
Never more to sail my ship
were no man has gone before
and I will go sailing no more

No, it can't be true
I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky
If I believed I could fly
Well, I'd fly

Clearly I will go sailing no more

toot toot hey beep beep
Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking About bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night, walkin'
Picking up on all kinds of strangers
If the price is right
You can't score if you're pocket's tight
But you want a good time

You ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else, they come from near and far

Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking About bad girls, yeah

Friday night and the strip is hot
Sun's gone down and they're out to trot
Spirit's high and legs look hot
Do you wanna get down?

Now don't you ask yourself who they are?
Like everybody else, they wanna be a star

Now you and me we're both the same
But you call yourself by different names
Now your mama won't like it when she finds out
That her girl is out at night
Street talkin', street walkin'

Hey, mister, have you got a dime?
Mister, do you want to spent some time? Oh, yeah
I got what you want, you got what I need
I'll be your baby, come and spend it on me

Sad Girls, you such a dirty bad girl
Beep-Beep uh uh
You bad girl you sad girl
you such a dirty bad girl
Beep-Beep uh uh
Instrumental
She's been playing that room on the strip for ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror but she only ages
She's been readin' 'bout Nashville and all the records that everybody's buying
Says "I'm a simple girl myself, grew up on Long Island"
so she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance

(First Chorus)
She's gone country, look at them boots
She's gone country, back to her roots
She's gone country, a new kind of suit
She's gone counrty, here she comes

Well the folk scenes's dead, but he's holding out in the village
He's been writing songs, speaking out against wealth and privilege
He says "I don't believe in money, but a man could make him a killin'
'Cause some of that stuff don't sound much different that Dylan
I hear down there it's changed you see
They're not as backward as they used to be"

(Second Chorus)
He's gone country, look at his boots
He's gone country, back to his roots
He's gone country, a new kind of suit
He's gone country, here he comes

He commutes to L.A., but he's got a house in the valley
But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
He says, "Honey, I'm a serious composer, schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days, this ain't no place for children
Lord, it sounds so easy, this shouldnt take long
Be back in the money in no time at all"

(Second Chorus)

(Third Chorus)
Yeah, he's gone country, a new kind of walk
He's gone country, a new kind of talk
He's gone country, look at them boots
He's gone country, oh back to his roots

He's gone country
He's gone country
Everybody's gone country
Yeah we've gone county
The whole worild's gone country
Come a little closer, baby
I feel like layin' you down
On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby,
I feel like layin' you down

Come a little closer, baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away
So come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go

If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
'till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
Back to the basics of you and me
What makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down

Come a little closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down
No matter what you do or say
She's always got to have her way
She'll bring you down just to cheer you up
You never know with a woman in love.

The minute you start holding on
You'll turn around and she'll be gone
This is very unpredictable stuff
You never know with a woman in love.

Chorus:
She's a lady, she's a child
She'll make you crazy, she'll drive you wild
Do you give in or do you just give up
You never know with a woman in love.
You never know with a woman in love.

I oughta know 'cause I've held a few
I've seen the things that a woman can do
She'll play the game 'til you call her bluff
Oh, You never know with a woman in love.

Just when you think you've got it all together
If you blink she'll change just like the weather, oh, oh, oh.

No matter what you do or say
She's always got to have her way
This is very unpredictable stuff
You never know with a woman in love.

Chorus:
She's a lady, she's a child
She'll make you crazy, she'll drive you wild
Do you give in or do you just give up
You never know with a woman in love.
You never know with a woman in love.

You never know with a woman in love,
You never know with a woman, oh, oh, woman in love...
Your cheatin heart,
Will make you weep,
You'll cry and cry,
And try to sleep,
But sleep wont come,
The whole night through,
Your cheatin heart, will tell on you...

When tears come down,
Like falling rain,
You'll toss around,
And call my name,
You'll walk the floor,
The way i do,
Your cheatin heart, will tell on you...

Your cheatin heart,
Will pine some day,
And crave the love,
You threw away,
The time will come,
When you'll be blue,
Your cheatin heart, will tell on you...

When tears come down,
Like falling rain,
You'll toss around,
And call my name,
You'll walk the floor,
The way i do,
Your cheatin heart, will tell on you...
Laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared

Well, the holes in the walls
Were such a lot
Welcome to London town
But when you’re new to it all
And you think you’re hot
You’re not planning on hanging around
People would go on their different ways
I left to start a band
A note came through the letter box
In your childlike hand

Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared

One day I rode to where you were
The doorbell jangled a note
They buzzed me in
I climbed the stairs
In my boots and leather coat
There’s an old brass
Standing there at the top
Without her witch’s broom
It almost seemed like a knocking shop
When the girls came out of their rooms

And they all stood around
And stared at me
Two brunettes and a blonde
Then the old brass shrugged and said
We don’t know where she’s gone
Later on I picked up the ball
And I took off down the line
I suppose by then I’d realised
You’d run into hard times

Oh, laughs and jokes
And drinks and smokes
And no lights on the stairs
We were young, so young
And always broke
Not that we ever cared
Not that we ever cared
I saw you starin' at each other
I saw your eyes begin to glow
And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hidin' nothin' that I don't know.

There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.

--- Instrumental ---

You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long.

'Cause there's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes.

There's an old flame burnin' in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burnin' longer...
Hey pretty baby are you ready for me
It's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
I'm just out of Austin bound for San Antone
With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on
There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
But no local yokel gonna shut me down
'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town
Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
And I ain't the kind to just hang around
But I heard someone callin' my name one day
And I followed that voice down the lost highway
Everybody told me you can't get far
On thirty-seven dollars and a jap guitar
Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town

Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop

Gotta keep rockin' why I still can
I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
But when my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
With my back to the riser I make my stand
And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
We're loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
One of these days I'm gonna settle down
And take you back with me to the Guitar Town
Love, you're getting lazy.
You're forgetting to give me
sweet sugar,
words that I wanna hear.
You been neglecting me,
you know jealousy it is bitter as a green spring berry.
And just like fruit from a fickle vine,
you turn sweet in the nick o' time.
Love, you only come alive
when you're losing me.
And it's a childish game,
I gotta shake you up just to wake you up
to make you love me.

(chorus)
I'll shake the sugar tree,
'til I feel your love falling all around me.
You gotta tend to what you planted,
and if you take my love for granted, baby,
I'll shake the sugar tree.

Another night and you're sleeping,
I'm awake and I'm dreaming.
Oh honey, 'bout the way that it used to be.
A little time's gone by,
now do you think that I'm content with the cooking
and the payin' the rent? No I wanna know if your love's all spent.

(repeat chorus)

I've got to raise some commotion,
before you show me some real emotion.

(repeat chorus and fade)
(Jim Brickman/Jack Kugell)

If there were no words
No way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears
No way to feel inside
I'd still feel for you

And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
All you give to me
You've opened my eyes
And showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
But in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart
Until the end of time...
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine

And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
'Cause all I need is you, my Valentine
You're all I need, my love, my Valentine
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on
The sound turned down
And a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I
On the walls around me
The way that it was
And could've been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away.

I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with my pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry.

Would it help if I turned
The sad song on
All by myself
Would sure hit me hard
Now that your gone
Or maybe unfold
Some old yellow lost love letters
Its gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you
By hiding this way.

'Cause', I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with my pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry.

Well, I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with this pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry...
She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Oh, and we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Oh, then I asked her, can I see you again

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Oh, then it happened one night, looking in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question, much to my surprise

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So we called the preacher, family and friends
And nothing's been the same since she said yes
I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes
She said yes
Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall
Chorus:

In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by

Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads its wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody

Repeat Chorus

Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands

Repeat Chorus
I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night

M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E

In the moon-light
Under star-light
Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are made of a different stuff

I believe love will always be the same
(Love)
Ways and means are the parts subject to change

Chorus:
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love
[Repeat Chorus]

I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you've hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face
Style is timeless and fashion's only now
(Lo-Lo-Love)
We've got the ways no one needs to show us how

[Repeat Chorus 4x]

It's a modern love
[Chorus]
I know what you're dreaming of
[Chorus]
What we've got is a method of--modern love
[Chorus]
(It's a method of)
It's a method of
Modern love
[Chorus]
(We know what we're doing, don't we)
We know what we're doing, don't we

In the moon-light, in the star--songs old as night
Oh what are we dreaming of?

It's a method of
Modern love

Well somebody's talkin'
He's whispering to me
Your place or my place
Well, which will it be
I'm gittin' weaker
And he's comin' on strong
But I don't wanna go wrong

Nickles and dimes
Memories and wine
She's on his mind once again
The same old stool
The same old fool
Played by the rules but didn't win
There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose
He'd try forgettin' but he knows that it's no use

Chorus
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more

She was his girl
His only world
That string of pearls that slipped away
A thousand dimes
A thousand times
He doesn't mind what they say
He fills the jukebox then plays the same old song
He fills his glass and then he turns her memory on

Chorus
But it's a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more

Chorus
He's got a fool hearted memory
It won't let him see
That she walked out the door
He's got a fool hearted memory
And he sits patiently
Here every night so it can fool him more
Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

[ piano ]

Now take all those precious dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
You know someday those crazy arms may hold somebody new
But honey I am going to be lonely every time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
and I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
and I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

in a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

it's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
she said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
it's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and see
hey mister give me two give me two now cos any two can play

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
money for muscle and another girl I dig
another hustle just to make it big
and walkaway walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids

she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
she put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
and in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

and now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
in any shooting gallery where promises are made
to walkaway walkaway
to walkaway walkaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
If I could grant you one wish
I wish you could see the way you kiss
Ooh, I love watching you baby
When you're driving me, ooh, crazy

chorus:
Ooh, I love the way you, love the way you love me
There's no where else I'd rather be
Ooh, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me
I only wish that you could see the way you love me
Love me, ooh, the way you love me

It's not right, it's not fair
What you're missing over there
Someday I'll find a way to show you
Just how lucky I am to know you

(Chorus)

You're the million reasons why there's
Love reflecting in my eyes

Album ~ Rascal Flatts

I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons
Finally content with a past I regret
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness
For once I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame trapted in the past for too long
I'm movin' on

I've lived in this place and I know all the faces
Each one is different, but they're always the same
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I face it
They'll never allow me to change
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong
I'm movin' on

I'm moving on
At last I can see life has been patiently waiting for me
And I know there's no guarentees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyones life
When all you can see are the years passing by
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

I've sold what I could and packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
[Chorus]
Wha- wha- what did she say?
Mmmm whatcha say, 
Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did.
Mmmm whatcha say, 
Mmmm that it's all for the best?
Of course it is.

[Verse 1]
I was so wrong for so long
Only tryna please myself (myself)
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don't really want no one else
So, no I know I should've treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever

[Hook]
So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man
Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you (for you)
So tell me girl

[Chorus]
Mmmm whatcha say, 
Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did

Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm whatcha say, (whatcha say)
Wha- wha- wha- wha- what did she say

[Verse 2]
How, could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go (love go)
And ooh, when I do with one chance
I just gotta let you know
I know what I did wasn't clever
But me and you were meant to be together

[Hook]
So let me in (let me in) give me another chance (another chance)
To really be your man
Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star we'll be living so large
I'll do anything for you
So tell me girl

[Chorus]
Mmmm whatcha say, 
Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm whatcha say, (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmmm whatcha say, 
Mmm that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm whatcha say, (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha- wha- wha- wha- what did she say

[Verse 3]
Girl, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I really need you in my life
Cause things ain't right, girl
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)
I don't want you to leave me
Though you caught me cheatin'
Tell me, tell me whatcha said (said) (said)

Well of course you did
Mmmm whatcha say, (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha- wha- wha- wha- what did she say
Oh, hello and goodbye
so fast it's gone
I can't get your face from my mind
can't get your eyes from my
can't stop your voices
on that day you told me directions to
where I don't know now
it all flew by me
so all I can do is hope that you
come my way
oh and you're nowhere near me
that you'll be there and hope that
with luck, I'll see you again

Oh I didn't get your name
nor you mine
or the time of day
but you're stuck on me like a fly on a table
oh I'm waiting here where we stood for just a moment
and you stole my way
and I, and I wonder will I see you again
and way, way
without the smile, the smile that blows away
the wait is too long
I want this thing to go on
and there's no way that I might find you again
I must walk a way

I'm all released by time
bump into each other
it seems so right
and say hey aren't you the
weren't you the
don't you think
but I don't think it's going to happen today
I fear you'll remain a dream
rain, rain on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
your life is burned
your life burned into me
it did it
will I ever
The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

When all of my hopes were dying
Her love kept me trying
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

(CHORUS)
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the FEAR SHE FEELS INSIDE
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side

I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her loving eyes

(CHORUS)

So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries
Fifteen minutes left to throw me together
For Mr. Right Now, not Mr. Forever
Don't know why I even try when I know how it ends
Lookin' like another, "Maybe we can be friends."
I've been leaving it up to fate
It's my life so it's mine to make

Chorus:
I ain't settlin'
For just getting by
I've had enough so-so
For the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low
So raise the bar high
"Just enough," ain't enough this time
I ain't settlin' for anything less than everything

With some good red wine
And my brand new shoes
Gonna dance a blue streak around my living room
Take a chance on love, and try how it feels
With my heart wide open
Yeah, you know I will
Find what it means to be the girl
Who changed her mind
And changed the world

Repeat chorus

I ain't settlin'
For just getting by
I've had enough so-so
For the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low
So raise the bar high
"Just enough," ain't enough this time

I ain't settlin'
For just getting by
I've had enough so-so
For the rest of my life
Tired of shooting too low
So raise the bar high

I ain't settlin'
No, no, no, no, no, no
So raise the bar high, high
We've been up all night long
Trying to solve a problem, well, it's almost dawn
Ain't no time for sleeping if our love is wearing thin
'Cause I ain't giving up, you ain't giving in.

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.

And real love walks, a real thin line
No communication will kill it every time
So open up your heart, baby we can work it out
'Cause we got the kind of love people dream about.

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.

It's past the point of right or wrong
Let's find a way to just hold on, yeah

--- Instrumental ---

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away
'Cause the life we've been living
Gets harder every day
Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away.

Don't let our love start slipping
Our love start slipping away...
Speakin of the devil
Look who just walked in
He knows just where to find me
Here we go again
I can tell he's gonna ask me to dance
Thats not as far as he wants to go
I need ten thousand angels
To help me tell him no

Chorus:
Lead me not into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight all that I'm feelin
But I can't do it alone
Help me break this spell that I'm under
Guide my feet and hold me tight
I need ten thousand angels
watchin over me tonight

It's time to face my weakness
Look him in the eye
Lord knows it wont be easy
but I've just gotta try
I cant let myself get lost in his arms
Thats how i got my heart broke before
I need ten thousand angels
To walk me out the door

Repeat Chorus

I need ten thousand angels
Watchin over me tonight

Ten thousand angels watchin over me tonight
(Repeat)
Come out, Virginia. Don't let me wait.
You Catholic girls start much too late,
Oh, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate.
I might as well be the one.

Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray.
They built you a temple and locked you away,
Oh, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done.
Only the good die young.
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

You might've heard I run with a dangerous crowd.
We ain't too pretty. We ain't too proud.
We might be laughing a bit too loud,
Oh, but that never hurt no one.

So come on, Virginia, show me a sign,
Send up a signal. I'll throw you a line.
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun,
Darlin' only the good die young
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation.
You got a brand new soul
Mmmmm, and a cross of gold,

But, Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information.
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary.
Oh oh ooh

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait.
Some say it's better but I say it ain't.
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
The sinners are much more fun,
Ya know that only the good die young
Oh oh oh, baby
I tell ya, only the good die young
Only the good die young

You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation.
Oh, she never cared for me,
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Oh oh oh

Come out, come out, come out Virginia, don't let me wait.
You Catholic girls start much too late,
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate.
I might as well be the one
You know that only the good die young
Tell ya baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young
Woo-oo-oo, hoo, hoo
Saw him sittin' on a sidewalk in Fresno
Braided hair and a tye-dyed t-shirt on
Talkin' to himself about Vietnam
'Bout the tour he did and the deal he got
He said, This world ain't the same if you ask me.
If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be.

I'd be rollin' on a river with Creedance
Stealin' kisses from Peggy Sue
I'd be knee-deep in sand on a Panama beach
In the spring of '72
I'd be wastin' away on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll in
He said, What I wouldn't give just to live those songs, again.

Saw him workin' the counter at Walgreens
With a new haircut and a Bachelor's Degree
Talkin' to himself about his raw deal
Cussin' Uncle Sam and the GI bill

If I could be somewhere else, I'd tell you where I'd be.

--- Instrumental to fade ---
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on
The sound turned down
And a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I
On the walls around me
The way that it was
And could've been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away.

I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with my pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry.

Would it help if I turned
The sad song on
All by myself
Would sure hit me hard
Now that your gone
Or maybe unfold
Some old yellow lost love letters
Its gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you
By hiding this way.

'Cause', I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with my pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry.

Well, I've never been the kind
To ever let my feelings show
I thought that being strong
Meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough
To let go of my pain
To hell with this pride
Let it fall like rain from my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry...
I was thumbing from Montgomery
I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dress like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son

Well I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride

Well he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said this is where you get off boy
I'm goin' back to Alabam
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said mister many thanks
He said you don't have to call me mister mister
The whole world calls me Hank

Chorus
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing
Have you paid your dues?
Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride
When the last, breath of life
Is gone from, my body
And my lips, are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather 'round
For my farewell party
Won't you, pretend you love me

There will be flowers from those
Who cry, when I'm gone
And leave you in this, world alone
I know you'll have fun
At my farewell party
I know, you'll be glad, when I'm gone

Don't be mad at me, for wanting to keep you
Till my life on this old world is through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you

There will be flowers from those
Who cry, when I'm gone
And leave you in this, world alone
I know you'll have fun
At my farewell party
I know, you'll be glad, when I'm gone

Oh, I know you'll be glad when I'm gone
Im meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
Theres no signin' up and no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury, or your Evin Rude and fire it up
And meet us out at party cove
Come on in the waters fine
Just idle on over and toss us a line

Bass trackers, bayliners, and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin loud all summer long!
Side to side theres five houseboat front porches
Astro turf lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular joes rockin the boat thats us!

I find myself more and more mistaking
myself for someone else

Hey, my love, I came to you with best intentions
You laid down and gave to me just what I'm seeking
Say, love, you drive me to distraction

Oh my love you believe that we might last a thousand years
Or more if not for this,
Our flesh and blood
It ties you and me right up
Tie me down, ah well,

Celebrate ah
Celebrate we will
Cause life is short but sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change

Hey, my love, you came to me like wine comes to this mouth
Grown tired of water all the time
You quench my heart and, love, you quench my mind and say:

Let's celebrate ah
Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short but
Sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot oh not today
Celebrate ah
Celebrate we will, you and me
Climb on two by two, to be sure
These days continue
Things we cannot change

Hey my love, I came to you
With best intentions
You, you laid down and gave to me
Just what I'm seeking
Say, love, won't you come celebrate...
Celebrate we will
'Cause life is short
But sweet for certain
We climb on two by two
To be sure these days continue
Things we cannot change...
Things we cannot change.
getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I choose
sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
and I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
and I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I am

in a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light
she had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

it's just the danger when you're riding at your own risk
she said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like this
it's just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and see
hey mister give me two give me two now cos any two can play

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

well it's been money for muscle another whirligig
money for muscle and another girl I dig
another hustle just to make it big
and walkaway walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids

she took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
she put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
and in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me
stay

and the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
and I'm just high on the world
come on and take a low ride with me girl
on the tunnel of love

and now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
in any shooting gallery where promises are made
to walkaway walkaway
to walkaway walkaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to walkaway

and girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did
like the spanish city to me when we were kids
What a difference you've made in my life.
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made in my life.

What a change you have made in my heart
What a change you have made in my heart
You replaced all the broken parts
Oh, what a change you have made in my heart.

Love to me was just a word in a song that had been way overused
But now I've joined in the singin'
'Cause you've shown me love's true meanin'
That's why I want to spread the news.

What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made in my life.

You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made, yeah.

What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made.

Go ahead and sing it.

What a difference you've made in my life
What a difference you've made in my life,
Yeah-heah-eah-eah-heah
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh yeah, sing it to me
What a difference you've made.

What a difference you've made in my life, woh-oh-oh-oh
What a difference you've made in my life
You're my sunshine day and night
Oh, what a difference you've made
What a difference you've made, in my life...
It sure gets quiet
When the kids go to bed
We lay here in the silence
Putting off what must be said

I read a book you watch T.V.
As our love dies quietly
I'm so sad
I don't know what I've just read

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids
And they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hopin somehow
We might need each other again

You say goodnight
And turn and face the wall
We lie here in the darkness
And the tears start to fall

If it as only you and me
Goodbye might come more easily
But what about
Those babies down the hall

Somebody should leave
But which one should it be
You need the kids
And they need me
Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We keep hopin somehow
We might need each other again

Somebody should leave
But we hate to give in
We just keep hopin
We might need each other again
(chorus)
How blue can you make me?
How long till I heal?
How can I go on lovin you when you're gone?
How blue can I feel?

Oh honey why did you leave me?
Ain't you go a heart left in your chest?
I swear to you that I'm dyin
Cause my mind won't let my body rest

(chorus)

If I sink any lower, I'll go under
If I cry anymore, I'll go blind
Lord there ain't no relief
For this 'missing you' grief
How long can you torture my mind?

(chorus)
How can I go on lovin you when you're gone?
How blue can I feel?
These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all god's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
Cause God's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
Because he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop

I wake up and right away
Her name is on my lips
Once the memories start to flow
I can't stop with just one sip

Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop

I keep on remembering
How good it used to be
Gettin' stoned all alone
On my favorite memory

Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
She's always on my mind
Her memory goes round and round
I've tried to quit a thousand times
Yes I admit I've got a thinkin' problem
Fill the glass up to the top
I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop

I'll start with lovin' her
But I don't know when to stop
Every where I go,
they're starin' at her,
every man I know.
He wants to have her
I guess I outta be a jealous man.

I look the other way
they're hittin` on her every night and day
they telephone her
they try and get to her
but I know they can't

[chorus]
Cuz she never lets it go
to her heart
she never lets it go
that far
when they start talkin'
she starts walkin'
right back to my arms
she can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart.

She walks into the room
and everybody watches every move
hopin' she don't love me
I know it by the way
they hang around.
but they don't realize
there's more to her than what meets the eye
that's why i'm certain
that no matter what they do
to reach her now

[chorus]
cuz she never lets it go
to her heart
she never lets it go
that far
when they start talkin'
she starts walkin'
right back to my arms
she can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart

she never lets it go to her heart

Close your eyes, baby, follow my heart,
Call on the mem'ries, here in the dark.
We'll let the magic take us away,
Back to the feeling we shared when they'd play.

Chorus:
In the still of the night, hold me darling,
Hold me tight, oh, shoo-doop, shoo-be do.
shoo-doop, doo; so real, so right
Lost in the fifties tonight.

These precious hours, we know we can't survive
Love's all that matters while the past is alive.
Now and for always, till time disappears,
We'll hold each other whenever we hear:

And you think I'm cool
But I don't, man

And maybe, it's too soon (it's too soon)
But I think it's too late (it's too late)
But things like bad timing just won't wait

Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
If she's the one or not

So I gotta go, gotta go,
Before I do something stupid

Well, I know flirting is nothing
And it should be where it ends,
But I know, yes I know
That I want you for more than a friend
More than a friend

Maybe it's not right
I have a girlfriend
Made a friend tonight
Who is a girl and
I just wanted to talk to you
But then I started wondering
Oh yes, I started wondering

So I gotta go, gotta go,
Before I do something stupid
I gotta go

Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered round and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
A-through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, oooh, yes he was

Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight?

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, Lord knows he was

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowing
Lookin' to see how much we've grown

And the only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, oh, yes he was
He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man
I guessed he was the son of a preacher man
Sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man
Ahh, move me

It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us 'til we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts

Before we both start falling apart

I Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
'Cause we've got better things that we can do
When it's raining on Sunday

Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender is much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls

And pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
And we'll hide under the covers all afternoon
And baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
'Cause we've got better things that we can do
When it's raining on Sunday
Ooh, oh oh

Ooh, oh oh
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain

I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
Of all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want
When it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth

I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you

You're the hope that moves me
To courage again
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds, rage
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far

I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms

I need you

You done leave me one time, baby you'll leave again
Dig in and suffer with me, an' I know you paid your dues
Dig in and suffer with me baby, an' I know you paid your dues
You done leave me when I need you, then I know you stand accused
Doing the man who loves you wrong
Breaking the heart you should be ruling
Doing the man who loves you wrong
I go for a lot of things, but you're a little too strong
Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end
Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end
You done leave me one time, baby, you'll leave again
Ha
i can almost hear the stillness
as it yields to the sound of your heart beaating
and i can almost hear the echo
of the thoughts that i know you must be thinking
and i can feel your body tremble
as you wonder what this moment holds in store
and as i put my arms around you
i can tell you've never been this far before

i don't know what i'm saying
as my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
i only know that i have waited
for so long for the chance that we are taking
i don't know and i don't care
what made you tell him you don't love him anymore
and as i taste your tender kisses
i can tell you've never been this far before

and as i take the love you're giveing
a can feel the tension building in your mind
and you're wondering if tomorrow
i'll still love you like i'm loving you tonight
you have no way of knowing
but tonight will only make me love you more
and i hope that you'll believe me
'cause i know you've never been this far before

If the [D] wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight [D7]

Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business

Well, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.

I got a little gal that wears her hair up high,

(Mind your own business)
Well, if you mind your own business, you sure won't be minding mine.

Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me.
Just mind your own business

From a little light of love
I was born and in my cry, my cry
Was a little light of love
For the honoring of life
And the pharons of my soul
Is this light of love
Precious little light of love

There's a candle burning on
In the breezy shades of night
I keep up my faith and underset my hope
To call the realm of light

A treasure
Your shiver
In the middle of the shady desert
Brings on a field of light
In a light of love
Fairy light of love

Only one religion
Will lead us to the love we aim for
Over the dark illusions
Of the warring nations

And when the figure leads to power
The destruction glorified higher
And when the war is nearly over
How come the leader's held in highest honors

Would you die
For their lie
The greedy hunting cry

You rely
On your light
Little loving light

A little light of sole religion
Well a little light of love
A little light of soaring freedom
Just a little light of love
A little light of sole religion
Take this little light of love
A little light of love and freedom
Take me
A little light of soul religion
A little light of love and freedom
Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ooh, she put her beer down
Here she comes

Left left left right left
Whoo

Husslers shootin' eightball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near 10 ft. tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him outta his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault

That honky tonk badonkadonk

Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
You ain't gotta hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma

We don't care bout the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch
That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on
Like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee
Shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There outta be a law
Get the Sheriff on the phone

That honky tonk badonkadonk

That honky tonk badonkadonk
Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk

(That's it, right there boys, that's why we do what we do
It ain't for the money, it ain't for the glory, it ain't for the free whiskey
It's for the badonkadonk)
One night when the moon was bright o'er a moonlight glade
That is where I found my little Cherokee maid
The me'mry of that night of love is lingering yet and I know I never will forget
My little Cherokee maiden I love her so and though we're far apart
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her for anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to the Cherokee strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies we'll live to paradise
My sweet little chickadee my little Cherokee maiden and me
[ sax ]
My little Cherokee maiden I love her so...
I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone
And I've seen first-hand Niagra Falls
And the lights of Vegas
I've criss-crossed down to Key Biscayane
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all
And all I can say is

[Chorus:]
How 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they somthin'
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothin'
And I tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls

She's a ridin' colts in Steamboat Springs
Bailing hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard
To fit in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces

[Chorus]

Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fightin' side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no on else

Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls
Boys ain't they somethin'
Sure some are proud girls
But you can't beat their lovin'
And I'll tell you right now girls
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls
How 'bout them boys
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
Hold your breath - it gets better
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me
Take the highway
Lord knows I've been gone too long
Lot of sad days, yeah
One day you'll turn around
and I'll be gone
And the time has finally come
for me to pack my bags and walk away
Hear me say...
I'll be back someday
But darlin' please don't
wait for me too long
There's just one place I can't stay
Memories of your love still linger on
And the time has finally come
for me to pack my bags and walk away
Here me say....
Take the highway
Take the highway
Take the highway
And the time has finally come
for me to pack my bags and walk away
Here me say...
Here you come knockin� on my door baby
Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
And you're lookin� right, lookin� good, lookin� like a woman should
So why is it so hard to find
A place to lay your pretty little head down once in a while
You run on a little tough luck baby
Don't you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
Come and get it

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your friend?

And who's the one guy that you come runnin� to
When your lovelife starts tumblin�?
I got the money if you got the honey
Let's cut a deal let's make a plan

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?

You might've run on a little tough luck baby
Don't you sweat it
Everything is waiting inside for you
You know I got it
So come and get it

Who's your daddy, who's your baby?
Who's your buddy, who's your man?
I've got a funny feeling
The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancing is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
The way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this
Unless you mean it like that
Cause I'll just close my eyes
And I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor
Spinnin' around
And around
And around
And around

They're all watchin' us now
They think we're falling in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this
I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again
Kiss me again
I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night
It was six in the morning when I made the county line;
There's someone I've got to talk to, can't get it off my mind.
He is just a kid, and he's in a pretty rough spot;
Two dimes to make a phone call, that's about all I got.

How's my boy today? I know it's been three weeks;
But you know how far I've got to go these days to make ends meet.
How's your mama now, with her new live-in friend?
Oh, how I hate the wounds that never seem to mend.

You said, "I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.
When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do;
Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you."

God bless the little hearts, there the ones who really pay
When Mom and Dad can't get along and they go their separate ways.
In a way I'm glad there's someone there to fill the empty space;
Tears of understanding stream down a dirty face.

You said, "I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.
When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do;
Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you,
Be like you,
Be like you.

He is quite a little man growin' up as fast as he can;
And I don't get to see him half as much as I had planned.
There's so much I need to tell him, so precious little time;
A little rain on the window, and a little wave... goodbye
You said, "I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.

When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do;
Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you.

He said, "I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.
When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do;
Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you.
I met you in No Man's Land
Across the wire we were holding hands
Hearts a-bubble in the rubble
It was love at bomb site

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

When I fell it was awful nice
Caught when not suspecting vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

Blasted by your booby traps
I felt the blow in both knee-caps
Your eyes did shine
Your lips were fine
And the device in your pants was out of site

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...
Chorus:
In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
It's playing all my favorite memories
One by one they take me back
To the days when you were mine
And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind

I don't need no quarters
Don't need any dimes
You filled it up forever
When you said goodbye
Heaven knows I love old melodies
They were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playing on my mind
Are driving me insane

Repeat chorus

Song by song those melodies
Were meant to ease the pain
But the kind that's playing on my mind
Are driving me insane

Repeat chorus

Tag
No I can't stop this jukebox in my mind

Repeat chorus
You can dance
Every dance with the one
That gives you the eye
Let 'em hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one
That holds your hand
In the pale moonlight

Just don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darling save the last dance for me

Oh I know
That the music's fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

Just don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darling save the last dance for me

Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
I love you oh so much

You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone, till it's time to go
If he asks, if you're all alone
Can he take you home
You've got to tell him no

Cause, don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me

Just don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So, darling save the last dance for me
Ooh, ooh darling, save the last dance for me

You can dance
Every dance with the one
That gives you the eye
Let 'em hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one
That holds your hand
In the pale moonlight

Just don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me
Oh, Oh, Oh darling save the last dance for me
Sa-a-a-a-ve the last dance for me

Dance...dance...dance (you can dance)
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed the way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blind by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

(Ladies &amp;amp; gentleman Mr. Elton John)
I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal oh

Don't let the sun go down on me yeah
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free ohh
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me
(Mr. Elton John)
Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in, said, "You can't win"
But one day the sun came a shinin· through
The rain had stopped and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying "I love you" to me

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
A one in a million you

I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill


Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth livin·again
For to love you to me is to live

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
A one in a million you
A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called "You"
One in a million you
A one in a million you
So you came from New York city
And you want to see the sights
You've heard all about those cowboys
And those crazy Texas nights
I see you've got your eye on something
Leaning on the bar
But the toughest ride he's ever had
Was in his foreign car
Chorus:
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
He's the Hollywood idea
Of the wild andd wooly west
In his french designer blue jeans
And his custom tailored vest
You think he's the real thing
But I think you oughta know
He can't even make it through
A one night rodeo. No.

Chorus:

So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside. no.
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
Don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside. no.
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
Don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride...
If I live to be a hundred
and never see the seven wonders
that'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

Chorus:
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
the spitting image of my father
and when the day is done
my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
but I've got friends that love me
and they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
and that's who I am

Verse 2:
So when I make a big mistake
when I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowin'
I will be just fine
'cause nothin' changes who I am

Chorus:
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
the spitting image of my father

my momma's still my biggest fan
Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy

It's all a part of me

Bridge:
I'm a saint and I'm a sinner
I'm a loser I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I am young but I am able

(Repeat Chorus)

That's who I am
I've been workin' all week, I can hardly wait
I got a houseboat rented down on the lake
My pickup's gassed up and loaded up and ready to go
I put out the word to all my good-time friends
We're meeting at the dock, that's where the party begins
Be there or be square
Come along, anything goes
Yeah, Bon voyage, tonight we're gonna rock the boat

Yeah, we're gonna motor out
Drop anchor in the middle
Drag out the guitars, and tune up the fiddles
Have loads of fun be lucky if she stays afloat
Yeah, we'll be makin' waves tonight
We're gonna rock the boat

Well, I can see us all now by the light of the moon
One big party on two pontoons
Flip-flops, tank-tops, bikinis, and no dress code
We'll be surrounded by acres of swimming pool
Wall-to-wall coolers and barbecue
Inboards, outboards, overboard
Throw me a rope
Come one, come all
Tonight we're gonna rock the boat

Yeah, we're gonna motor out
Drop anchor in the middle
Drag out the guitars, and tune up the fiddles
Have loads of fun be lucky if she stays afloat

Come one, come all, tonight
We're gonna rock that boat...
Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times
I was so sure this would be the night
You'd close the door
And wanna stay with me
And it'd be so easy
To tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times

Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Because he'll always take you in
Just when you think
You've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Because he'll break you every time

So put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Now it's morning
and the phone rings and ya say
You gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave
Before you change your mind
And if you knew
What I was thinking girl, I'd turn around
If you'd just ask me one more time
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Because he'll always take you in
Just when you think
You've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Because he'll break you every time
so put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye
In 1814 we took a little trip
along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
and we caught the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.

*Chorus*
We fired our guns and the British kept on comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

We looked down the river and we've seen the british come
and there must have been a hunnerd of 'em beatin on the drum.
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
but we stood behind our cotton bales 'n' didn't say a thing.

Chorus

Ol' Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
if we didn't fire our muskets 'till we looked 'em in the eyes.
We held our fire 'till we seed their faces well
then we opened up the squirrel guns and really gave em....
well we

Chorus

Well they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
they ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

We fired our cannon 'till the barrel melted down
so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.
We filled his head with cannonballs, powered his behind
and when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind.

Chorus

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
A down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

KAW- [Dm] LIGA, was a wooden Indian standing by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
KAW-LIGA - A, just stood there and never let it [A7] show
So she could never answer &amp;amp;quot;YES&amp;amp;quot; or [Dm] &amp;amp;quot;NO&amp;amp;quot;.

He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
KAW-LIGA - A, too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knotty pine.

CHORUS
[D] Poor ol' KAW-LIGA, he never got a kiss
[G] Poor ol' KAW-LIGA, he don't know what he missed
[D] Is it any wonder that his face is [A7] red
KAW-LIGA, that poor ol' wooden [D] head. ... [Dm]

KAW-LIGA, was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
KAW-LIGA - A, just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer &amp;amp;quot;YES&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;NO&amp;amp;quot;.

Then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her, oh, so far away, but ol' KAW-LIGA stayed
KAW-LIGA - A, just stands there as lonely as can be
And wishes he was still an old pine tree.

CHORUS
You’re so complicated - you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don’t appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they’re on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I’m really feelin’ frustrated
Why don’t you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you’ll see

Don’t freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It’s definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don’t freak out until you know the facts
Relax - Max

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Don’t be stupid - you’re my baby

I’m mad about you (I‘m mad about you)
Can’t live without you (can‘t live without you)
I’m crazy bout you (I‘m crazy bout you)
So don’t be stupid - you know I love you

Don’t be stupid - you know I love you
Don’t be ridiculous - you know I need you
Don’t be absurd - you know I want you
Don’t be impossible
People think you're tough,
but you only pretend to be.
A real man would live alone
and feel no pain, like me.

When your baby said she was leaving
you slapped yourself in the face.
You clung to her and cried
and cracked all over the place.

Because you're a weakling.
You're a suckling lamb.
You're not so tough.
You're just a man.

I was only talking when I said to you
whatever it was I said.
I didn't mean anything.
Just put it out of your head.

Now you look to me like I'm ready to give
but I only just wanted to play.
You're trying to cop a feeling
while I'm trying to get away.

You're a big guy, but you're cut down to size
when you're left all by yourself.
Well I'm not paid to babysit
and don't ask me to help.

Let go of me and fall
into the arms of another
I'm the wrong girl for you.
I'm not your mother.

I'm an island. I'm a rock.
My head's an emtpy mental block.
You can't get lovin' from a stone.
I ain't no goddam foster home.

You're a weakling.
You're a suckling lamb.
You're not so tough.
You're just a man.

You're a weak thing.
Just a little lamb.
You're not so tough.
You're just like a woman.

Anything you can do I can do better
Girls will do it all without the aid of a mother.
Anything you can do I can do better
Girls will do it all without the aid of a mother.
Anythign you can do I can do do.
I'm not your mother. I'm not your mother.
Amanda, I know what you're thinking,
You and I have much to say,
And you've been making me crazy,
Trying to understand
But it's impossible at your age.
I know I said I'll always try,
But you're going to bed alone again tonight,
And you lie there in the dark and wonder why.

(Chorus)
I did it for you, and the boys
Because love should teach you joy
And not the imitation
That your momma and daddy tried to show you
I did it for you, and for me
And because I still believe
There's only one thing
You can never give up
Never compromise on
And that's the real thing you need in love

You're so afraid your life is over
And nothing I can say can change your mind
How can anybody be so selfish
And treat you all so cruel
Go on and scream at me and cry
I'll always hold you in my soul
And I'm never going to leave you all alone
But your daddy doesn't live here anymore

(Chorus)

Everybody's got a boat upon the ocean,
Not everybody's sailing out to sea,
And is there someone there for me?
I'm ready to believe.

(Chorus)
Here we go

Some men are attracted
To a pair of big blue eyes
It takes a pretty face
To make their temperature rise
Looks aren't that important
Just icing on the cake
What really turns me on
Is the shake.

(Chorus)
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Come on baby you know what I like
Shake it real funky
Shake it real low
Shake it 'till you can't shake it no more
It's a natural attraction
Mother nature wouldn't make a mistake
What really turns me on
Is the shake

Eve first said to Adam
Which outfit do you like
The maple or the fig leave
Now honey they both look nice
Clothes don't mean that much to me
Baby you better go and ask the snake
What really turns me on
Is the shake

(Chorus)
Shake it to the left, shake it to the right
Come on baby you know what I like
Shake it real funky
Shake it real low
Shake it 'till you can't shake it no more

You came into my hotel life
You made my room a home
Ah now, mama, don't you know what you done

You changed an old man filled with pity
Back to a child again

So tell me darlin' if the feeling's wrong
Don't waste another day
Lord, the saddest thing I've ever known
Was to watch it die away

Oh, how can my giving find the rhythm and the time of you
Unless you sing your songs to me
The smell of your sweet skin does entangle my dream
Oh may I stand here awhile living your smile

Oh, how could you ever know what you've done
You warmed my heart when I was so all alone
But all I have to give
Are my dreams of coming and going forever
Inside the rivers of time you'll find me waiting
For you to find peace in your mind
So we can love again

I feel what you feel,
If you feel what you feel,
And I see what you see,
If you see what you see,

All you'll find is peace of mind.

That keeps growing strong...
The longer I'm with you
The deeper and deeper in love I fall
You've got the moves
That move me so much
You've got the touch

You've got the moves
That move so much
You've got the touch
Baby cried the day the circus came to town.
'Cause she didn't like parades just passing by her.
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown.
And she danced without a net upon the wire.
I know a lots about her'cause you see. Baby is an awful lot like me.

Chorus
We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside. Leam how to hide our feelings, fly high and proud.
And if you should fall remember you almost had it all.

Baby saw the day they pulled the big top down.
They left be-hind her dreams among the litter.
And the diff'rent kind of love she thought she'd found was nothing more than sawdust and sorne glitter.
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see. She had the finest teacher, that's me.

Chorus
I taught her don't cry out loud, just keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud.
And if you should fall remember you almost had it.
Don't cry out loud, keep it inside..........
Someday I'm gonna be famous,
Do I have talent, well, no.
These days you don't really need it,
Thanks to reality shows.

Can't wait to date a supermodel,
Can't wait to sue my dad.
Can't wait to wreck a Ferrari
On my way to rehab.

Chorus:
'Cause when you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
You' can act just like fool
People think you're cool
Just cause you're on TV.
I can throw major fits
When my latte isn't just how I like it
They say I've gone insane,
I'll blame it on the fame,
And the pressures that goes with
Being a celebrity.

I get to cry to Barbara Walters,
When things don't go my way.
I'll get community service
No matter which law I break.

I'll make the supermarket tabloids,
They'll write some awful stuff
But the more they run my name down,
The more my price goes up!

Chorus:
'Cause when you're a celebrity,
It's adios reality.
No matter what you do,
People think you're cool,
Just cause you're on TV.
I can fall in and out of love,
Have marriages that barely last a month.
When they go down the drain
I'll blame it on the fame
And say it's just so tough.
Being a celebrity.

So let's hitch up the wagons and head out west
To the land of fun in the sun
We'll be real world bachelors
Jackass Millionaires
Hey, Hey, Hollywood
Here we come!

Chorus:
Yeah, When you're a celebrity
It's adios reality
No matter what you do,
People think you're cool,
Just cause you're on TV.
Being a celebrity.
Yeah celebrity!

Pardon me you left your tears on the jukebox
and I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry it's just that i noticed you, goin out of your mind
It look like we're two of a kind

Chorus
Let's fall to pieces together
why should we both fall apart
lets fall to pieces together
right here in eachother's arms

alone is much better together
when the worst is still yet to come
so lets share the rest of the tears that are left
from two hearts that just came undone
why should we go crazy alone

They said your love life's in trouble in a magazine I read
When the one you love is hangin' off of his side of the bed
Baby, your just barley hanging on
Honey I know you'll soon be gone

And I don't need my palm read to know what lies ahead
I can see you in the arms of another girl instead
Baby this ain't the first time that youve done this to me
Honey it's gonna be the last time

And I know that you'll be thinkin' I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's true
I ain't gonna cry no more for you
Uh-uh

Now I know where I'm goin' baby I know where I'm bound
I've been rearanging chairs on a ship that's goin' down
Baby, just step aside if you would
Honey, it's really over for good

And you might want to talk to me, you might want to call
But you won't hear nothin' out of me at all
Cause Baby, I ain't got nothin' left to say
Honey, I'll just be on my way

And I know that you'll be thinkin' I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

I don't care who or what you're doin'
Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'
Baby this time I swear it's the truth
I ain't gonna cry no more for you

And I know that you'll be thinkin' I'll be goin' out of my mind
Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds
Oh but baby I'm down to my last teardrop
Baby I'm down to my last teardrop
Baby I'm down to my last teardrop this time

Go on, go on
Until you reach the end of the line
But I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down

I know, I know
That one day, you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time

She’s a broken lady, waiting to be mended
Like a potter would mend a broken vase
A broken lady, waiting to be mended
And have what’s left of the pieces put back in place

Her love is like a fortress around a man she would have died for
Taking care to take care of all he needed
But the ladies fortress slowly turned into a prison
And the warning signs he gave she never heeded
She vowed every morning that what god joined together
No one else in the world could pull apart
And then the walls came tumbling to the ground
And her world came crashing down around her heart

Now she’s a broken lady, waiting to be mended
Like a potter would mend a broken vase
A broken lady, waiting to be mended
And have what’s left of the pieces put back in place

She’s a broken lady, waiting to be mended
Like a potter would mend a broken vase
A broken lady, waiting to be mended
And have what’s left of the pieces put back in place

"She's My Kind Of Rain"

She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

She sits quietly there
Like water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

Thumbing through the personal want ads

Starry skies and dreams come true
I've believed it since I first met you

I believe in new beginnings
Extra innings, brand new starts
Loving hearts that care the way I do
All these things and happy endings too

Sad songs bring me right down with the blues
Glad songs take me wherever I choose
And I choose to be there
So that I
Can declare why

I believe in happy endings
You're the reason, love's the way
And I'll believe it till my dying day

I know the cost of tears and trouble
Some get lost, some make it through
Me, I made it, 'cause I always knew
That you believed in happy endings too

You can dance
Every dance with the girl who gives you the eye
Let her hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the girl who'd like to treat you right
'Neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me
Oh I know

Go and have your fun
Dance and sing
But while we're apart don't give your heart to anyone

The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
They'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home
Well I left Kentucky back in '49 and
Went to Detroit workin' on the assembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
Cuz I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it outta there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least 100 grand

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
Cuz I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all 4 shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out my buddy's mobile home
Now up to now my plan went alright
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that somethin' was definitly wrong
The transmission was a '53 and
The motor turned out to be a '73 and
When we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit and
With a little help from an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had 2 on the left and 1 on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all 3 of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well that's when we noticed that we only had 1 tail fin
About that time my wife walked out and
I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said
"Honey, take me for a spin"
So we drove uptown just to get the tags and
I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
Cuz to type it up it took the whole staff and
When they got through the title weighed 60 pounds

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.

Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and kiss and that's too bad
She said I can go to work until you find another job
I thought I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom.

Well, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom.

Football, soccer and ballet
Squeeze in scouts and P.T.A.
And there's that shopping list she left
That's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom.

Well, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom.

Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time.

'Cause, Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the eighteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
Oh, been crazy all day long and it's only Monday
Mr. Mom.
Ooh Mr. Mom.

Balancin' checkbooks, jugglin' bills
Thought there was nothing to it
Baby, now I know how you feel
What I don't know is how you do it. Oh.

Honey you're my hero!...
I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
On the darkest day there's always light and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it falling in the night and filling up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light and I see it all unwind
I hear it talking through the trees and on the window pane
And when I hear it I just can't believe

I never liked the rain
Like the rain I have fallen for you and
I know just why you Liked the rain always calling for you
I'm falling for you now
Just like the rain

When the cloud is rolling over thunder striking me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you falling
Like the rain I have fallen for you and
I know just why you Liked the rain always calling for you,

I'm falling for you now Just like the rain
I have fallen for you I'm falling for you know just like the rain
And when the night falls on our better days
And we're looking to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways
to look into the eye of the storms that will be calling
Forever we'll be falling Like the rain I have fallen for you,
and I know just why you Like the rain always calling for you,
I'm falling for you now just Like the rain
I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain always calling for you,
I'm falling for you now just Like the rain
I have fallen for you and
I know just why you Like the rain always calling for you,
I'm falling for you now just Like the rain

Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
Like the rain
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you
Is a moment I treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what your dreaming
Wondering if it's me your seeing
And then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together
I just wanna stay with you
In this moment forever

I don't wanna close my eyes


I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
Well, I just wanna be with you, right here with you
Just like this
I just wanna hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

They both need resoled

If I ever settle down
You'd be my kind

To head on down the line

Heard it in a love song (3x)

I'm the kinda man likes to get away
Like to start dreaming about
Tomorrow, today
Never said that I love you

Where's that duffle bag of mine?
It's time to go

Heard it in a love song (3x)
Can't be wrong

I'm gonna be leaving
At the break of dawn
Wish you could come
But I don't need no woman taggin along
I'll sneak out that door
Couldn't stand to see you cry
I stay another year if i saw teardrops in your eyes

Heard it in a love song (3x)
Can't be wrong

I never had a damn thing, but what I had
I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing
I ever tried to get off of my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born wrangler and a rounder
and I guess I always will

Heard it in a love song (3x)
Can't be wrong
Yeah

Well, it's a long way from Star,Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

CHORUS:
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Whoo!

Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams

(Chorus)

Whoo!

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame

They might know me all around this world
Thats alright
But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi---- girl

Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a dog-gone pity
Teardrops are fallin' down the mountainside
Many times I've been here and many times I cried
We used to be so happy, when we were in love
High on a mountain of love.

Night after night I been standing here alone
Weeping my heart out till cold grey dawn
Prayin' that you're lonely and you come here too
Hopin' just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
Tryin' hard to find you, somewhere I love
High on a mountain of love.

Mountain of Love, a mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed you name.

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church and a big tall steeple
Inside the church there's an alter filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and it should have been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, I dream from above
High on a mountain of love...
Wanna tell you a story,
About the house-man blues
I come home one Friday,
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said that don't confront me,
Long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent,
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady,
I said, "You let me slide?"
I'll have the rent for you tomorrow
Or the next day I don't know
So said let me slide it on you know people,
I notice when I come home in the evening
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me,
But for five year she was so nice
Lord she was lovey-dovey,
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?",
I said, "No, can't find no job,
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent"
She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"
Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner,
Leaning up against a post"
I said "But I'm tired, I've been walkin' all day"
She said "That don't confront me,
Long as I get my money next Friday"
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent,
And out the door I went

So I go down the streets,
Down to my good friend's house
I said "Look man I'm outdoors you know,
Can I stay with you maybe a couple days?"
He said "Uh, let me go and ask my wife"
He come out of the house,
I could see it in his face
I know that was no
He said "I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, you know"
I said "I know, everybody funny, now you funny too"
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent
She said "Yeah?" I said "Oh yeah"
And then she was so nice,
Lord, she was lovey-dovey
So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go,
I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go
She a-howlin' about the front rent, she'll be lucky to get any back rent,
She ain't gonna get none of it
So I stop in the local bar you know people,
I go to the bar, I ring my coat, I call the bartender
Said "Look man, come down here", he got down there
So what you want?

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
Well I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when,
I've been drinking bourbon, whiskey, scotch and gin
Gonna get high man, I'm gonna get loose,
Need me a triple shot of that juice
Gonna get drunk, don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

But I'm sitting now at the bar,
I'm getting drunk, I'm feelin' mellow
I'm drinkin' bourbon, I'm drinkin' scotch, I'm drinkin' beer
Looked down the bar, here come the bartender
I said "Look man, come down here"
So what you want?

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since the night before last,
Gotta get a drink man, I'm gonna get gassed
Gonna get high man, I ain't had enough,
Need me a triple shot of that stuff
Gonna get drunk, won't you listen right here,
I want one bourbon, one shot and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

Now by this time I'm plenty high,
You know when your mouth a-getting dry you're plenty high
Looked down the bar I say to my bartender
I said "Look man, come down here", he got down there
So what you want this time?
I said "Look man, a-what time is it?"
He said "The clock on the wall say three o'clock.
Last call for alcohol, so what you need?"

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
No, I ain't seen my baby since a nigh' on a week,
Gotta get drunk man, so I can't even speak
Gonna get high man, listen to me,
One drink ain't enough Jack, you better make it three
I wanna get drunk, I'm gonna make it real clear,
I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
I wash my faith in dirty water,
'Cause it gives my mind a little order.
And I play that game, just like I should do.
But my whole world, slips away.

I live my life, I live it slowly.
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry, yea... I'm livin'...
And when I go then I would surely.

I would dance with a total stranger,
And hold them in my arms.
Hell, there could be no danger if I open up up,
'Cause when the cryin' starts so,

If I chant for happiness,
Maybe that will make me feel better?
I can't change my ideals, I can't lose my desire
Ohh, if I chant for happiness maybe that will make me feel better?
I'd be your newborn friend for the world.

Well I wash my face in dirty water.
For life I have no order.
'Cause I,
Know that feeling when you've tried to make your way out,
Nothing mends.
So you search for the breed of the problems there lying,
Deep down in the soul.
And if, they never end,
There's a whole bunch of reasons, tryin' to get out
But they can't make it out of the door.
Ohh, I know the reason,
I'm not enough.
There's nothing more... But,

If I chant for happiness, maybe that will make me feel better.
I can't changes my ideals, I can't put out the fire.
Ohh, if I chant for happiness, maybe that will bring us together,
For the better...
I can't changes my ideals, I can't lose my desire.
I'm just a newborn friend for the world...
Just a newborn friend for the world...
I'll be your newborn friend and I'll...

Sing loud... Sing loud... Sing loud... my friend
sing loud......sing loud......sing loud.

Gonna sing louder sing loud sing loud my friend
...sing louder... ...sing loud... ...sing loud...

To my friend my friend and I...

I'll sing love, sing loud, sing a little louder of my friend.
Ohh.. my friend
Ohh, my darlin friend my friend my friend

Ah, na-da da, da...
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me, all night long.
So many lover's games I could play with you
and on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong

Chorus:

But on the other hand, There's a golden band
To remind of someone who would not understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand


In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes I found myself
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else

Repeat Chorus
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind
Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart
And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
But right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart
Don't go breaking my heart

I'm a travelin' man
I've made a lot of stops all over the world
And in every port I own the heart
Of at least one lovely girl

I've a pretty Seniorita waiting for me
Down in old Mexico
If you're ever in Alaska stop and see
My cute little Eskimo

Oh my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return

Pretty Polynesian baby over the sea
I remember the night
When we walked in the sands of the Waikiki
And I held you oh so tight

Oh my sweet Fraulien down in Berlin town
Makes my heart start to yearn
And my China doll down in old Hong Kong
Waits for my return

And I held you oh so tight

Oh, I'm a travelin' man
Yes, I'm a travelin' man
Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place
To spend the night
Heavy rain's a-fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
It's alright

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a-flashing
Taxi cabs and buses passing
Through the night
A distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain
To the night

It's a rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
And Lord I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
Well, it's life and you just got to play the game

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take my guitar
To pass some time
But late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
Then I feel fine, I feel fine

But it's a rainy night in Georgia
Baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia
And Lord I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin'
All over the world
Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
In the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half of your butterfly tattoo.

Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park.

'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks.

I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you when we get there is me.

You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want.

'Cause I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks.

You never know where one might be
There's lots of places that are hard to reach
I gotcha.

I'd like to see you out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you baby way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks.

I'd sure like to check you for ticks...
i get drunk and i stumble to the phone.
and conjure up a bitch to bone
when i'm alone.
fucked up, tore back.
i need to take a piss.
only when i'm drunk,
i sing a song like this.
my grandma and your grandma...
...sittin by the fire.
hold on, turn that beat off.
na, keep it going.
crazy town, yo y'all just not knowin'.
i get drunk and start talking more shit.
and when i got a gun in my hand,
you better get...
...out 'cause my brain
just ain't what it used to be.
forget trying to rationalize,
cover your eyes.
i get...(uh!)...damn i'm drunk
i need a chunk. no better yet.
a hunk of that funk.
i get...(uh!)...damn i'm drunk
i need a chunk. no better yet.
a hunk of that funk.

hold up. wait.
i think i'm gonna throw up.
na, false alarm.
i'm getting all the ladies with my cool charm.
when i get drunk,
i might even call my daddy a punk.
yeah, but only when i'm drunk.

CHORUS:
yeah, only when i'm drunk.
only when i'm drunk.
yeah, only when i'm drunk.
it happens only when i'm drunk.
it goes, one for the chronic.
two for the amnesia.
i'm that crazy white boy
with the drinks in the freezer.
bust a one out, two out.
blitz type of rapper
that will get out of your seat
quicker than a car jocker.
sippin' colt forty fever
when i'm coolin' with my people.
got hos in east columbus.
like i'm Billy D. Rico.
'cause i move like i'm smooth.
like i'm harry belafonte.
lookin' for them suckers
that jumped my homey. Le Le.
all up in this bitch
with the gin and tonqueray.

smoke bud like Dr. Dre.
but that's 'cause i'm old enough
to do that type of shit.

i pass the mic to Mr. Shift.
i get drunk and can't nobody
whoop me.
i'm trippin'
it must be that brew that that i was sippin'

'cause when i'm laying on my back,
i can feel the room spin.
one too many, i rekon.
feelin' i got to hurl any second.
want to get up but can't move.
feels like i'm stuck in a groove.
what the fuck was i trying to prove.

all the hos know them doobie bros.
people call me shift
i keep a fifth in my trunk.
i might fuck an ugly bitch,
but only when i'm drunk.

CHORUS
yeah, one two, one two.
only when i'm drunk.
Would've never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way

Well, he opened my eyes
To a world beyond
That impossible dream
I was living on

And I thank my lucky stars each night
When you're in my arms and you're holding me tight
I realize what it means to have your true love

I would've never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way

And I thank my lucky stars each night
When you're in my arms and you're holding me tight
I realize what it means to have your true love

When I look back on my life before
How my heart got shattered with a slamming door
I see how it all had to be for the two of us

Oh, the river of tears
That flow from my eyes
Was only moving me on
To this paradise

I would've never found you
If he had wanted to stay
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way
Oh, he hurt me bad
In a real good way
Free is all you gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
Sometimes ya wanna run away
But ya never know what might be comin' round your way
Ya ya ya

On a day like today
The whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine
Shine thru the rain
On a day like today
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
Ya never wanna see the sun go down

Somewhere - there's a place for you
I know that you believe it too
Sometimes if you wanna get away
All ya gotta know is what we got is here to stay
All the way

On a day like today - the whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine - shine through the rain
On a day like today - no one complains
Free to be pure - free to be sane
On a day like today
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
Ya never wanna see the sun go down

Free is all we gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
But ya never know what might be comin' for you and me
Ya it's gonna be

On a day like today
If you got a Cadillac boy
And a 40 room shack boy
A bucket full of money
And a tree full of honey
But if your gettin' no huggin'
No smoochin' or a muggin'
If you ain't lovin'
Than you ain't livin'
If you're ridin' on a gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lover's lane
You can't make hay boy
Cause your goin' the wrong way boy
You gotta get a little honey
It's better than money
If you ain't lovin'
Than you ain't livin'
If they call you a big man
Cause you got a lot of bottom land
If you're kin to the President
And ya get help from the Government
But if your gettin' no attention
You're better off on a pension
If you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'
If you got a string of long cards
And your smokin' them four-bit cigars
You ain't so well to do
Unless you get a little coochy-coo
It takes a little bit of smackin'
Or your lifes lackin'
If you ain't lovin'
I took a walk in the rain one day
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react

Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I would not disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night, tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette

I take my chances
Forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I've crossed lines of words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
Now I can cry until I laugh and laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
I'll play from either side

I take my chances
I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances
I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get
I take my chances

I take my chances
Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boy's around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothin' more

I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool hopin' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I hadn't been that far before
The first time's a one time feelin and I never wanted nothin' more,
No I never wanted nothin' more..

(Chorus)
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And thats all I need

My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say "I do"
A little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothin' more

(Chorus)

One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothin' more

(Chorus)

Never wanted nothin' more...
And I never wanted nothin' more
A couple of days, isn't a very long time.
Why can't I just walk away,
I used to be good at goodbye.
But out on the water,
Under the stars,
I let the moonlight play a trick on my heart.

[Chorus]
You had some fun for the weekend.
But I'll be in love for the rest of my life.
You took me out to the deep end,
And I fell right over,
I didn't think twice.
I finally got something worth keepin'.
And if I can't have you tonight,
At least I had the weekend.

The radio plays, the sound of the waves rollin' in.
The smell of the night,
Sure can get under your skin.
Just for a moment,
I held you too close.
Now I'm all out of time, and I don't wanna let go.

[Chorus]

How much can happen in a night or two?
I guess it's all depending on your point of view.

[Chorus x2]
I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I wasn't comin' back, said I'd had enough
Saw you in the rear view standin', fadin' from my life
But I wasn't turnin' round
No, not this time

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

When we make choices, we gotta live with them
Heard you found a real good man and you married him
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind
Where would we be today
if I never drove that car away?

Don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
Yeah I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't think about it

Don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think you don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been should've been all worked out
I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

No no, don't think I don't
Don't think I don't
