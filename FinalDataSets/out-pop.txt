Chorus
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don’t know
And don’t care (don’t care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She’s just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don’t care
Won’t care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won’t let me go nowhere
He thinks because I’m at home
I won’t be gettin’ it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It’s getting out of control
Finally I can’t take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don’t know
And don’t care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever
We gone forever

The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright

The sleepy city is dreaming the night time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be OK
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy

A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day...
She's got both hands in her pockets
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger around you

I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen, and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, Why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She does the cabbage patch
And the mustyle
She likes electro she wrote hip hop
She like the regge she feel punk rock
Kill
1,2,3,4
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You gotta stand tall and cut away the ties
Drop walls and hold that head up high
The world is fast and youth ain't gonna wait
So grab a hold before it gets to late
Bare your soul and strip away the cold
Of withered life that's past so gray and cold
Cause all the pain that's filled these eyes you see
Was made to bleed just recently

Tears that made me,
Ashamed to be me,
But that gave me,
Strength to see me,
Made a spark that lit the dark that let me shine

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

'Cause it's time we come together
Be on because I'm bout to So do it now or never
I fall sleep to freeways far from here
Spend half the night just drinking beer
From this day on shall be the words
My flesh and bones shall make it hurt
Don't you test
I'll have to mess with you
Do my best so fuck the rest of you
One of these days you'll see I've always been right, right

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

Ouuu Ouuu

And it makes me glad When I see the sun
And it makes me sad When you feel my one
And I thank my god Got a girl like you
And I thank my god Did you save me

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
this pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
this pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
this pain that I feel deep inside
So, what am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me, slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

Chorus:
This is for my girls all around the world(around the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Never can, never will...

So What am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history it's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK,
The guy can get away with it the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make it change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

Chorus:
This is for my girls all around the world('round the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth(repect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Lil' Kim:
Now here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore

But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
cats take my ideas, and put they name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got Yo back

Your just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
You're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things

(This is for my girls)This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground(stand our ground)
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Uh Oh, Uh Oh
*uh, uh,uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Can't Hold us down*
Lil Kim:

*Can't Hold us Down*
Used to dream of being a millionaire, without a care
But if I\\\'m seeing my dreams and you aren\\\'t there
\\\'Cause it\\\'s over, that just won\\\'t be fair

Darling, rather be a poor woman living on the street, no food to eat
\\\'Cause I don\\\'t want no pie if I have to cry
\\\'Cause it\\\'s over when you said goodbye

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Now that you\\\'re gone

From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Since you\\\'re gone

Now I see myself through different eyes, it\\\'s no surprise
Being alone will make you realize
When it\\\'s over, all in love is fair

I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there
I shoulda, shoulda

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Now that you\\\'re gone

From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Since you\\\'re gone

I know I pushed you away, what can I do that would save our love
Take these material things
They don\\\'t mean nothing, it\\\'s you that I want

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Now that you\\\'re gone

From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Since you\\\'re gone

I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there
I shoulda, shoulda

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Now that you\\\'re gone

From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Since you\\\'re gone

Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm
It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fists would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
And every morning that I wake I look back on yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echoes of a broken child screaming please no more
Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done
For you it's just a memory but for me it still lives on

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back on yesterday

It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see, next

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love you gave
And every morning that I wake, I look back on yesterday
And I'm OK

i've changed
i've tried
to live the way that you do
i've forgotten problems animosity enraging
foward futures doomed in my eyes
i was raped of my mind
control was never my possession
guided like a puppet on a thread
it was ready, ready to break
emotions stronger, stronger than ever before
burning inside my weakness counting the times
repetition starving
i'm racing against time
out of line i've had enough
i've suffered long enough
i'm wasting all my time
out of line i've had enough
i've suffered long enough
hey, if you hear me, listen to my words
i've taken just abou everything
i'm through being hurt
[Verse One]
I'm the most critically acclaimed, rap bitch in the game
Coast to coast, stash the gat in holster girl
Dark skinned, Christian Dior poster girl
Mo' rockin Timbs bitch and the Gucci loafers girl
Niggaz say I'm too pretty to spit rhymes this gritty
Fuck y'all thought? Be dancin around in suits like I'm {Diddy}
Pretty, show niggaz how we run this city
Respect my name, Boogie nigga, stay in ya lane
Like The Hurricane, rains on bitches like Sugar Shane
And dare one of y'all rappin chicks to mention Fox name
"What's Beef?" Beef is when bitches think it's sweet
See y'all frontin in the streets and let my gat meet ya

1- Why Yoooooooo, Why yo yo yo
Why Yoooooooo, Why yagga ya yo
Why Yoooooooo, Why yo yo yo
Why Yoooooooo, Why yagga ya yo (yagga yo)

Check, uhh
It's like I'm in my own fuckin world, I speak how I feel
Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin real
I love to stack riches, no disrespect y'all
I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm a in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

repeat 1

I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed it with the Trini' rum and whiskey
Uhh, proper set off
Six sped off, gats let off, I speak calm
Gangsta, and pours off like Screechie Don, bwoy
Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggaz stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe
When Fox come through she a go done de place
I'm like Marion Jones, what, who the FLUCK wan' race?
Listen, never trippin, never catch Brown slippin
Fuck, y'all only nice around mics like Pippen
Shit, to all my thugs that's Blood'n or Crip'n
I'm still shittin, still lowridin and switch-hittin nigga

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da

When you have reached the age Uh Huh

Teeny bopper is our new born king Uh Huh

Chorus:

And The Beat Goes On

Drums keep poundin a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da

The grocery stores are super marts Uh Huh
Little girls will break their hearts Uh Huh
And men still keep on marching, off to war
Electrically they keep their baseball score

And the beat goes on, the beat goes on

Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain
La-dee-da-dee-dee
La-dee-da-dee-da

Grandma's sitting chair's in reminisce
Boys keep chasing girls to get a kiss
The cars keepa going faster all the time
Bum still cries "Hey buddy have you got a dime?"

We're strong, we're weak, we're tired
We're straight, we're gay, we're bi
We're black, we're white - why
To tell the truth, we lie
We get so trapped inside our little lives
They disappear, before our very eyes

[Chorus]
So come on live it up tonight
Live it up tonight, move on
It's time we gave it up tonight
Live it up tonight

We won, we lost, we tried
Be a saint, i'm fine cos i died
I'm so sick and tired of crying
So tonight, it's time, just fly
So now we got so close
Caught up in the deal

The only thing we had is real

[Repeat chorus]

So we can keep it, make it real
Can't you feel

Though it hurts so bad
To say goodbye
I know my love for you
Is still alive

[Repeat chorus x2]
Oh I could give a straight up goddamn
I could give you four or five of them
I got a thousand in my bank account
break it open let the goddamns walk out

All my traumas hinge upon
Some convoluted axiom
Of the cube of x plus y
Equals itself divided by now

Where have you gone?

I been to south of highland falls before
I am a waiter in a furniture store
I'm in demand and i'm unsure why
I get to roll with the flyest of the fly

All my limbs are sticks and lines
My head's a point upon my spine,
I can't get no quadrilateral
I can't say half empty or half full now

And slapping at the angles of the shape you're in,
Left sleeve in velvet,
Right sleeve in sharkskin
All your laughs snapping like a dog bark
Left here looking for girls that glow in the dark
(feat. Ne-Yo)

[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I cant stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No...)

[Ne-Yo:]
But you wont let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
can't remember what you did

[Rihanna:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
so that I cant stay mad at
you
for too long that's wrong

[Ne-Yo:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch,
so that I dont want to fuss and fight no more
said I despise that i adore you

[Rihanna:]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah...)
I cant stand how much I need you (I need you...)
and I hate how much I love you boy (oooh whoa...)
but I just can't let you go
and I hate that I love you so (oooh...)

[Ne-Yo:]
You completely know the power that you have
the only one that makes me laugh

[Rihanna:]
Said and it's not fair
how you take advantage of the fact
that I.. love you beyond a reason why
and it just ain't right

[Ne-Yo:]
And I hate how much I love you girl
I cant stand how much I need you (yeah..)
and I hate how much I love you girl
but I just can't let you go
but I hate that I love you so

[Both:]
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
and your kiss won't make me weak...
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
so you'll probably always have a spell on me...

[Ne-Yo:]
Yeaahhh... Oohh...

[Rihanna:]
That's how much I love you (How much I need you)
That's how much I need you (How much I love you)
That's how much I love you (oh, need you)
That's how much I need you

[Rihanna:]
and I hate that i love you soooo...
And I hate how much i love you boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (can't stand how much I need you)
and I hate how much I love you boy
but I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go no..)
and I hate that I love you so

[Both:]
and I hate that I love you so... soo.
Driving home to be with you
The highway's dividing, the city's in view
As usual, I'm almost on time
You're the last thing that's on my mind
I wish I could tell you the way that I feel
But tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel

No commotion, no screaming brakes
Most of it's over before I awake
From the ceiling, my coffee cup drips
While out my window, the horizon does flips
The worst part was hitting the ground
Not the feeling so much as the sound
Can't help but wonder if all this is real
'Cause tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel

Rubberneck traffic and passersby
And Slow Motion Walter, the fire engine guy
Stand around with their mouths open wide
I heard some idiot ask if someone's inside
With the Jaws of Life they tried and they tried
Nobody here can know how I feel
'Cause tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel

I guess it's over now
'Cause I've never seen so much
Never seen so much, never seen so much
Never seen so much, never seen so much
I guess it's over now
'Cause I've never seen so much
Never seen so much, never seen so much
So much blood

In all the confusion there's something serene
I'm just a posthumous part of the scene
Now, I'm floating above, looking in
As the radio blares and wheels spin
I can see my face slump with a grin
And you, you're the last thing on my mind
You're the last thing on my mind
You're the last thing on my mind
You're the last thing on my mind

Suddenly, things become unsound
Stumbling on the shakey ground
Given arrows to shoot tornados down, shoo them down
To the ground

Saw a falling leaf,
Much to our surprise, a butterfly
And it sunk in this


HIDDEN SUN

Suddenly, things become unsound
Stumbling on the shakey ground
Given arrows to shoot tornados down, shoot them down
To the ground

Saw a falling leaf, a good luck, jump to grab
Much to our surprise, a butterfly
And it sunk in this induration, induration
In our lives

CHORUS
Inside ourselves
A hidden sun that burns and burns
It never does any harm to anyone

Shivering madly in the dark
Like an animal abandoned in the car park
And she held me, and the she showed me
The beauty of the human heart

CHORUS
CHORUS

Anyone
Oo, anyone
Hidden sun

Hidden sun
Oo (sun, sun, sun)

I've given my heart only to you
while you stand there thinking about it.
There's nothing more that I can do
when you're hiding what you feel inside.
The closer we get the farther you run from the voice
that speaks from the heart.
The higher we climb the harder we fall

So don't leave me hanging'
don't leave me hangin' on!

Look over you shoulder then leave it behind

put all the heartbreak away.
We'll start all over
one step at a time

don't let the past take my place

It's heart over mind
heart over mind.

Time after time you say:
Give up
it's too hard for you to give in.
Don't let the hurt speak louder than love

don't live yesterday again.
Your mind's holding back what your heart's letting go

I'm fighting to help set you free.
I'm wanting you
you're needing me

So don't leave me hangin'
don't leave me hangin' on!

Look over your shoulder then leave it behind
. . .

Time heals the wounded and I know you will survive

Let's pick up the pieces
and put them together again
together again.

Ooh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)
Does your mama know about me
Does she know just what I am
Will she turn her back on me

And what about your dad
Did you think of what he'll say
Will he be understanding
Or does he think the usual way

Maybe I shouldn't worry

Before I'm knocking on your door

If she says forget about me
Do you think you'll understand

I know will surely come your way

Oh, we've got to stand tall
Tumble or crawl
We've got to be strong
For a love that's so right
Can't be wrong

I don't wanna let it go
That's why I gotta know

How does it feel being in these arms?
what's it really like to be loved?
i've been alone now, how long?
have you ever loved the way that i have?
and i have often wondered who,
who could love you the way i do?
now i just want you to know, how i'm touched deep in my soul just being with you.
and i need you more each day.
baby, if you're still awake,
call me when you get this.
i've got all this poetry now i didn't know then.
i kept inside. guess i had never seen anything beautiful
till i first saw you asleep at night.
and i have often wondered who,
who could love you the way i do?
now i just want you to know,
how i'm touched deep in my soul
just being with you.
and i need you more each day.
baby, if you're still awake,
call me when you get this.
i just wanted to know what it was like, what's it really like to be loved?
these little volcanoes came as a surprise to me.
i never thought i could be this way.
and i have been cautious and i've tried to keep to myself, but who could love you the way i do?
now i just want you to know, how i'm touched deep in my soul.
just being with you.
so much more each day,
baby, if you're still awake,
call me when you get this
I could lose my heart tonight
If you don't turn and walk away
'Cause the way I feel I might
Lose control and let you stay
'Cause I could take you in my arms
And never let go

CHORUS:
I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still
So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you
And I know it's not right
And I guess I should try
To do what I should do
But I could fall in love
fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

como yo podria amarte.

So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

(CHORUS)
i could fall in love with you, (i could fall in love with you)
i could fall in love with you

I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
I could fall, fall in love with you

Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in
darling I know, I know this will be
Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

(repeat chorus)

ohhhhhh

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know...oh yeah

(repeat chorus)

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back
Let me take you to a place I know you want to go
it's a good life

I wanna stand around and beg you
just don't say no

I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it what I'm doing to you

And I know what I'm doing
I'll be doing what you want to me to do.

Love is shining

A feeling that you get from the good life.
Once you get the good life feeling

No more bad times
only glad times in the good life

When the good look in then it feels as good as a good life.
I want you to want me

Axamillion morals, difference in opinion
I was with him, he had 7 jack and cokes in him
They had platform heels, nose job bills
And some look like their ill with the fucked up grill
Supermodels on my 'D', 1 2 3
He said &amp;amp;quot;2 for you, 2 for me&amp;amp;quot;
Face like a saint, suckin' like a sinner
Cocaine makes you thinner, cocaine makes you thinner


Chorus:
I got supermodels on my 'D' (3x)


Like Roger Grimsby on eye witness news
Man he'll tell you the truth while he's singin' the blues
Just like gasarama on Avenue B
He'll check under the hood, man he'll teach you Tai Chi
He laughed and with a gesture bought a drinks for the girls
He said &amp;amp;quot;You gotta have the love in this fucked up world&amp;amp;quot;
You gotta have the love in this fucked up world
You gotta have that sweet, sweet love
That keeps you warm at night - ooo bop bop shabba
You gotta have that love, for the world
the world ain't what it's cracked up, get it cracked up to be - ha ha ha
Shoo be doo bop bop


I got Supermodels on my 'D' (8x)


Can't you see, can't you see
That I got a supermodel on my 'D' (repeat to end)
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet, just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down cuz they just get in my way

The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister
You high-five your goodbyes and it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
I just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

So over summer something changed
I started reading 17 and shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religously
And I walked right in school and caught you staring at me

'Cause I know what you know but now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day but not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be a homecoming queen, be a poster dream
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower not a dirty weed
And I wanna smell like roses not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day you're gonnna wanna
Make out make out make out with me

So I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
I just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys
Too much is on your mind
Gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
You say you need a break
There's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you

Baby, what's this you tell me
Things ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight

After the Rain Vincent Vega meets Sven De Mar 
Who can say when things go wrong
Just rolling with the changes?
Time is short, the list is long
Of words that I have wasted (very short)

You see baby I
I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line

I got my heart up in air
But I begin to wonder
Will you be here in time?

In time
Whoooo
In time

How do I act differently
I thank you for asking
Stronger than I used to be
Or can you not imagine?

I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line

A much straighter line
A place to jump in
I'm ready to fight

I see my soul reaching out
I hear your voice in the clouds
Is there no straighter line
I'm ready to win

I got my heart up in air
But I begin to wonder
Will you be here in time?

In time
Whoooo
Will you be here

I see my soul
I see my soul keep reaching reaching reaching reaching out
Reaching reaching reaching out

Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, that you'd stay forever
So if you must go
Well, darlin', I'll set you free
But I know in time
That we'll be together
Oh, I won't try
To stop you now from leaving
Cause in my heart I know

(chorus)
Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong
I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days
Our love will lead you back

One of these nights
Well I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say, oh how much you missed me
You'll walk out this door
But someday you'll walk back in

Sometimes it takes, sometime out on your own now
To find your way back home

(Rodney Crowell)

Just like the sun over the mountain top
You know i'll always come again
You know i love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin.

I've never gone so wrong as to telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can.

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again.

Like a lighthouse you must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again.

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again...
We look up, silently
Without quite music
My face four days old
You look newborn
There's fear in your frown, like mine
No distance away
Noticing your hand
Half round my head
And on my face
Protecting me, protecting me
Afraid of your frown, don't change
For me expressions
A button undone
The earth that's on my back
And in my hair
Portraying me, portraying me
You're so clean, untouched
Like me experience possessed
She breathes so tence
Flexes her hand
Don't relax
Projecting me, projecting me.....
(Don Gibson)

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

You don't love me, it's plain
I should have known you'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you...
My sexy love... (so sexy...)

[Verse 1]
She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
And I errupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
Babygirl you make me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Babygirl you make me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)

[Chorus]
Sexy love girl the things you do
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung keep running back to you
Who I love making love to you
Babygirl you know your my (sexy love...)

[Verse 2]
I'm so addicted to her she's the sweetest touch
Just enough
Still too much say that I simp and I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)
And I just can't think (of anything else I'd rather do)
Than to hear you sing (sing my name the way you do)
When we do our thing (when we do the things we do)
Oh, Babygirl you make me say (Ohh ohhh ohhhh)

[Chorus]
Sexy love girl the things you do
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung keep running back to you
Who I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know your my (sexy love...)

[Verse 3]
Oh baby what we do it makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' til it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do if I would lose your touch
That's why I'm always keepin' you around... my sexy love

[Chorus:]
Sexy love girl the things you do (things you do baby)
(Oh baby baby) Keep me sprung keep running back to you (keep me runnin' back to you)
Who I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know your my (sexy love...)

[Chorus:]
Sexy love girl the things you do (sexy love)
Keep me sprung keep running back to you (keep me runnin' back to you)
Who I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know your my (sexy love...)

She makes the hairs on the back of my head stand up
Just one touch...
Status seekers -
I never cared
Once I found out
They never dared
To seize the world and
Shake it upside down
And every stinking bum
Should wear a crown

Sayin' I
Cry for love
Till all the plates are broken
Cry for love
Until my eyes are soakin'
Yeah I
Cry for love
Oh every sammy morning
Yeah I
Cry for love
'Cause imitation's boring
Cry for love

Bad TV that
Insults me freely
Still I know what
I'm dyin' to see
In searching for
A meaningful embrace
Sometimes my self-respect
Took second place

An' I
Cried for love
I did what my heart told me
Cried for love
Can't stand it
When they scold me
Yeah I
Cried for love
On every sammy morning
Yeah I
Cry for love
'Cause imitation's boring
Cry for love

Surfers ride for love
And wipe out when it hits 'em
Soldiers kill for love
And nobody admits it
If you're cryin' for love
Well, that's ok
Don't sweat it
If you're cryin' for love
Then there's still a chance
You'll get it
Cry for love

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered "good-bye" as she got on a plane
Never to return again but always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right
(It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
My heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
But I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore
(Duet with Jimmy Cozier)

Somethin' about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish I could know if you're alone, don't wanna cramp your style
But I cannot deny the feeling that I feel when I look straight through your eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for her challenge, may you try

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair

Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe I've had too much for me, my man's right by my side
Every time I catch you watchin' me I feel somethin' down my spine
I play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (you do)
I think you hopin' there's a chance for me and you (and you)
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't? (we can't)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair

I know all you wanna know is answers
'Cause you could gimme what I need
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires lead?

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be

Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr. Man

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (you do)

She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama,si, bonita,si, mi casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa,
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that

Come on lets go, real slow
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto

And I am starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche

She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

Come on let's go, real slow

No fighting

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)

Dime que paso
Se te olvido mi nombre
O ya quiza, yo no te importo mas
Yo te conozco bien
Tus ojos no lo esconden
Estas indiferente y me hace mal
Si nuestro amor no da mas
Asi como se fue otro vendra

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel
Amandote
Si ya se acabo tu amor
Me quedo con la fuerza de poder tener
A quien querer

El tiempo que te di
no fue tiempo perdido
yo me quede con lo mejor de ti
Me diste una ilusion
Un sueno y un destino
La fe que me faltaba por vivir
Si nuestro amor no da mas
Asi como se fue otro vendra

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel
Amandote
Si ya se acabo tu amor
Me quedo con la fuerza de poder tener
A quien querer

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Si ya se acabo tu amor

Oh, si necesitas algo tu de mi
Yo estoy aqui
No fuiste solo uno mas
Algo muy mio vive en ti

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel
Amandote
Si ya se acabo tu amor
Me quedo con la fuerza de poder tener
A quien querer

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel
Amandote
Si ya se acabo tu amor
Me quedo con la fuerza de poder tener
A quien querer

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel
Amandote
Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

(Think about it)
On the day that your mentality
Decides to try to catch up with your biology
Come round!
'Cause I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over.. my face
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over.. my face

A double bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor
A double bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor
And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
It's written all over my face

These are the riches of the poor
These are the riches of the poor
And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the railway station
It's all over my face
Just somethin' about you
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
Gettin' scared now, right
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right, listen

I kinda noticed something one night,
In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so is datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And if you let go the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember

Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Yeah
You know I could make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, hold my jacket
And then...

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just want to love you baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby)
Girl....

(Pusha T)
Ma' whatcha wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'
Point to me I say 'Yea, it's the same dough'
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night

(Malice)
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
(I just love your....brain..)
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain'
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl..
Maybe we'll fly the night away

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya

You will know the difference when I --

(Break it down)

You know
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way
Drums... (Hey)

It's kinda special right, yeah
You know, if you think about it
Sometimes people are just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

Now everybody dance
The time is right
You hold me tight
And love's got me high

Please tell me yes
And don't say no, honey
Not tonight
I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave 'till I see the
Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)

The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We'll take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland
Now move a little closer to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait

(No , listen girl)

I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We'll explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
That love won't let me wait, no

Love won't let me wait (my temperature's rising)
Love won't let me wait (cause your so tantalizing)
(Oh listen girl)
Love won't let me wait
My captive heart... (My captive heart...)
My willing soul... (My willing soul...)
(Repeat)

I see him walkin', I sense the danger
I hear his voice, and my heart stops
He wears a face of the night--ooh, the perfect stranger
And I'm falling, ready or not
I don't think about it
Who knows where the wind blows?
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

My captive heart (He holds the key to these emotions)
My willing soul (Let me drown in this ocean)
And I carry the flame
And I play my part
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart

My captive heart... (My captive heart...)

Fire burns, so I've been told
But I like the way it feels
He has a wild passion that drives away the cold
And I know (And I know) his touch is real
I don't think about it
He leads and I follow
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

My captive heart (He holds the key to these emotions)
My willing soul (Let me drown in this ocean)
And I carry the flame
Like I did from the start
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart

(Instrumental)

I don't think about it
Who knows where the wind blows?
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

[Spoken:] My love.
[Sung:] He holds the key to these emotions
Let me drown in this ocean
And I play my part
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart, oh oh

(Repeat chorus and fade)

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)
I feel like
I've been locked up tight
for a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone
to release me
You're lickin' your lips
and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean
I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby...)

Ooohhh, 'my body's sayin' lets go'
Ooohhh, 'but my heart is sayin' no'

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way

You gotta make a big impression
gotta like what you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come come, come and
on and let me out

The music's playing
and the lights are low
It's one more dance
and we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing
at the speed of a light
But that don't mean
It's gotta be tonight
Baby baby baby (baby baby baby...)
ohhhhhhhhh
Ooohhh, 'my body's sayin' lets go
Ooohhh, 'but my heart is sayin' no'

Little girl don't be sad I've set your eyes on fire
Don't say I'm a liar that I don't love you
Something has brought me down but I won't give up hope
It's hard for you to cope when I'm around you

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The grey sky fades to blue
It might wash away this gloom

Alcohol, company I need to readjust
From this place of dust let's go drink tonight
And at the bar we'll drink 'til dawn and I'll pretend I'm dead
Whilst resting my poor head by the neon light

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The grey sky fades to blue
It might wash away this gloom

The birds will sing for us but we all die in the end
The birds will sing for us but we all die in the end
The birds will sing for us, the birds will sing for us
The birgs will sing for us but we all die in the end

It was love at bomb site

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

When I fell it was awful nice
Caught when not suspecting vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

Blasted by your booby traps
I felt the blow in both knee-caps
Your eyes did shine
Your lips were fine
And the device in your pants was out of site

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

[Verse - Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

[Chorus - Robin Thicke] (2x)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you - girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh! ohh!

[Verse - Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine
When she's around nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Uhh! picture this all
Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life - and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!

I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away
I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide?
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)

Day after day, alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool.
And he never gives an answer .....
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Well on his way, his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices, talking perfectly loud.
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make.
And he never seems to notice .....
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around
We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

Let the river run
let all the dreamers wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem.

Silver cities rise
the morning lights the streets that lead them
and sirens call them on with a song

It's asking for the taking
trembling
shaking
Oh, my heart is aching

We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

We the great and small
stand on a star
and blaze a trail of desire
through the darkening dawn

It's asking for the taking
Come run with me now
the sky is the color of blue
you've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover

Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

It's asking for the taking
trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching

We're coming to the edge

your sons and daughters

Let the river run
let all the dreamers
wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem
I don't know why
The sky is so blue
And I don't know why
I'm so in love with you
But if there were no music
Then I would not get through
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do

I don't know why
But somewhere dreams come true
And I don't know where
But there will be a place for you
And every time you look that way
I would lay down my life for you
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do

I don't know why
But some are going to make you cry
And I don't know how
But I will get you by, I will try
They're not trying to cause you pain
They're just afraid of loving you
I don't know why
I know these things, but I do

I don't know why
The trees grow so tall
And I don't know why
I don't know anything at all
But if there were no music
Then I would not get through

Hungry people dont stay hungry for long

Tha spirit of Jackson
Now screams through tha ruins
Through factory chainsAnd tha ghost of tha union
Forgotten remains
Disappear to their new homes
Tha knife tha thrust
Tha life burns to the raw bone
Tha blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin
Cover the spread sheets
Tha Dow Jones skyin
Cell block live stock
Tha bodies their buyin
Old south order
New northern horizon

Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
Livin been warfare
I press it to CD

A fire in the masters house is set

Check tha high tech terror
Yes tha new order athletes
Peer into tha eyes of tha child already on trial
Armies rippin families apart
Get em on file
Convictions fit tha stock profile
All tha while films of dogs
Cutting through homes
Ripping skin from bones
Yes tha new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes
An era rising
Of tha old south order
New northern horizon
Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
Livin been warfare
I press it to CD

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
Finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven

Oh, thinkin' 'bout our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now, nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now,
You keep me coming back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe,
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're in heaven

Now, nothing can change what you mean to me
there's a lot that I could say
Just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe,
We're in heaven
Love is all that I need

We're In heaven

Now our dreams are coming true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you....

When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide from that old
Loving You feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you.

I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close we were too far apart.

I gave you my love
I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try
This loving you feeling
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling loving you
That loving you feeling again...

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I’m not your type, But I can make you sway.
It makes you burn to learn, You’re not the only one
I’d let you be if you put down your blazing gun.

[Rihanna]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).

[Both]
‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It’s hard not to give in.

[Adam]
I’m lost, I can’t tell
Where you end and I begin.

It makes you burn to learn
I’m with another man.

[Adam]
I wonder if he’s half
The lover that I am.

[Adam]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).

Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don’t deceive me
Talk to me bout taking your time
(Talk to me, talk to me)

When I saw her she looked my way

Ruby lips on a smile so sweet
With a rude attitude that could knock me dead

I heard a voice when she called my name

I knew my life was gonna change

Well she's hotter than hell

You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore

So I`ll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'til there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I’m not your type, But I can make you sway.
It makes you burn to learn, You’re not the only one
I’d let you be if you put down your blazing gun.

[Rihanna]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).

‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It’s hard not to give in.

The lover that I am.

What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You better think about it twice
While you're out cheating on your woman
There's something you never even thought of, and that is

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love [(hear me now]
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I've seen so, so many fellows
Fall in that same old bag
Thinking that a woman is made to,
To be beat on and treated so bad
Oh, fellows, let me ask you something
I'm sure that you never even dreamed of,
[repeat chorus]

I know there are some women gives the other excuse
I'm not tryin' to run your life, boy it's up to you
Oh, you oh, you,

Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh, that's when it all happened
Something I never, never dreamed of

Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Somebody was-a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Now who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I Get High, I Get High
I Get High, I Get High
I Get High, I Get High
I Get High on your memories
High on your memories
High on your memories

I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
Highhhh (In background thoughout song)

[Verse One- Styles]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.: the only flow'er that you know with a bounce in a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get, high cuz I'm in the hood, the guns in around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin up
Cuz if I'm sober dogg, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite
I'm in the zone all alone, muthafucka 'case I'm dyin tonight
So I roll em up back to back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come to slide to the hood

[Chorus]
I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
I Get High, high, high, high
Highhhh

[Verse Two- Styles]
Ayo, I smoke like a chim-in-ney
Matta fact I, smoke like a gun
When a killa see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did
Add to that, that I smoke like the Hippies did back in the 70's
Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand
Like the M-5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high cuz fuck it, what's better to do
And I'ma neva give a fuck cuz I'm better than you

[Chorus]

[Verse Three- Styles]
I'ma smoke til my lungs collapse
I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dolla bill is powerful
I smoke weed cuz time seem precious, and I know what a hour do
High for a livin, gots ta ride for a livin
Wit my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin
Shit I get as high as I could
Cuz if you see things like I see things
Cuz I'ma die in the hood
Muthafucka understand its full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it aint purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die
This is S.P. dump it in, you bitch I get high

[Chorus Til Fade]

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)
I could lose my heart tonight
If you don't turn and walk away
'Cause the way I feel I might
Lose control and let you stay
'Cause I could take you in my arms
And never let go

CHORUS:
I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still
So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you
And I know it's not right
And I guess I should try
To do what I should do
But I could fall in love
fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

(-spanish solo-)
Siempre estoy so'ando en ti
besando mis labios,
acariciando mi piel,
abrazandome con ansias
imaginando que me amas
como yo podria amarte.

So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

(CHORUS)
i could fall in love with you, (i could fall in love with you)
i could fall in love with you

I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
I could fall, fall in love with you
i could fall in love with you
The power of love is a curious thing
make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
more than a feeling, that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
make a bad one good make a wrong one right
power of love that keeps you home at night

Chorus 1 :
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
that's the power makes the world go'round

Chorus 2 :
And it don't take money, don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
when it gets hold of you
and with a little help from above
you feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
Can you feel it ?
Hmmm

Chorus 3 :
It don't take money and it don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
you won't feel nothin' till you feel
you feel the power, just FEEL the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
feel the power of love
No sleep
I haven't slept for a week
And I'm cold
Yeah I'm so cold
She's right
I should do somthing with my life
But I'm old, I'm old I'm getting old

Those eyes
She said they don't recognize me
Those lips
They're never calling my name

It feels heavy
It feels so heavy, heavy
I'm waiting for a saturday
I'm waiting for a saturday
And I'm too young to be old

Une fille jolie
Passait tout pres de moi
Elle arretait le temps
Au coin de st. catherine et st. laurent

Elle me regardait
Et elle souriait
Elle m'a fait penser a rien en ce moment
Mais comme le vent elle s'en allait
Et moi j'suis reveiller
Ouai moi j'suis reveiller

Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her ?

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? Never !
Who said I'd lied because I never ?
I was detained, I was restrained
Broke my knee
Broke my spleen
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied? - Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor ...
...I drank more

Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

Set free me why don't you
get out my life why don't you
Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on

Set me free why don't you girl
get out my life why don't you girl
Cause you don't really love me, no, no, no,
You just keep my hanging on
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
Finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven

Oh, thinkin' 'bout our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now, nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now,
You keep me coming back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe,
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're in heaven

Now, nothing can change what you mean to me
there's a lot that I could say
Just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe,
We're in heaven
Love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're In heaven

Now our dreams are coming true
Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you....

Love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're in heaven

We're in heaven
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her ?

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? Never !
Who said I'd lied because I never ?
I was detained, I was restrained
Broke my knee
Broke my spleen
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied? - Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor ...
...I drank more

Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

Set free me why don't you
get out my life why don't you
Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on

Set me free why don't you girl
get out my life why don't you girl
Cause you don't really love me, no, no, no,
You just keep my hanging on
