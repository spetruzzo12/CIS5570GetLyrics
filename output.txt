Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you tonight
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
The phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Yes, baby
Can't see nothin' in front of me
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
I make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile of line

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
I was wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li

There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li

I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mixed with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line

Sky of blackness and sorrow (a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness (a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow (a dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65 I was seventeen and running up one-oh-one
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69 I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes, I see them running too

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me, you know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on) You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind) Running into the sun but I'm running behind
Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver, know he's doing alright
Hear him whip the women just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good?
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should, uh huh

Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wond'ring where it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doing alright
You shoulda heard him just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good, now?
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should, now

You shoulda heard me just around midnight

Ah, brown sugar, just like a young girl should, yeah

Outro:

Girl we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Strokin' round and round
To the remix
We jus' thuggin' it out
I'm Feelin rough I'm Feelin raw I'm in the prime of my life.
Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives.
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars.
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars.

This is our decision to live fast and die young.
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun.
Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends.
We were fated to pretend.

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms.
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world.
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home.
Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone.

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do.
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew.
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce,
we'll find some more models, Everything must run its course.

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end.
We were fated to pretend.

yeah yeah yeah
At first I was afraid,
I was petrified,
kept thinking I could never live without you by my side,
but then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,
and I grew strong,
and I learned how to get along!

And so you're back, from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
if I had known for just one second,
you'd be back to bother me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
and I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself,
I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high,
and you see me,
somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
and so you felt like dropping in,
and just expect me to be free,
but now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive,
I will survive,
I will survive!

Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
Tigers waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

Nothing else compares
Oh, no nothing else compares
Oh, no nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof.
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fire-proof.
Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be.

(Under the Boardwalk)
Out of the sun.
(Under the Boardwalk)
Man, we'll be having some fun.
(Under the Boardwalk)
People walkin' above.
(Under the Boardwalk)
We'll be falling in love under the Boardwalk,

Boardwalk.

From the palms you hear the happy sounds of the carousel,
and you can almost taste the hot-dogs and french fries they sell.
Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
on a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be.

(Under the Boardwalk)
Out of the sun.

'Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick
The one that makes me scream,' she said
'The one that makes me laugh,' she said
And threw her arms around my neck
'Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you...'

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
'Why are you so far away?' she said
'Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?'

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream
Just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
I found myself alone
Alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heaven
Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen, and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, oh yeah

I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away

Woah, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Oh, I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen and I like it
They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

CHORUS (SHE)
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

CHORUS (SHE)

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

CHORUS (HE)
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American, he wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?

Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have

CHORUS (YOU)
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?

CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times ad lib)
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American
Hey Sister, Go Sister, Soul Sister, Go Sister
Hey Sister, Go Sister, Soul Sister, Go Sister
He met Marmalade down in Old New Orleans
Struttin' her stuff on the street

Heh, Heh, Hehhhh
Seeing her skin feeling silky smooth
Colour of cafe au lait
Made the savage beast inside
Roaring till it cried More, More, More
Now he's at home doing nine to five
Living his brave life of lies
But when he turns off to sleep

One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small,
And the ones that Mother gives you don't do anything at all.
Go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall.

And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall,
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call.
Call Alice when she was just as small.

When men on a chessboard get up and tell you where to go,
And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low,
Go ask Alice -- I think she'll know.

When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead,
And the White Knight is talking backwards,
And the Red Queen's off with her head,
Remember what the dormouse said.
Feed your head, feed your head...
Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long 'til I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
What I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it, you put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you

She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow girl

When I make my move to her room it's the right time
She's never hard to please

From her head down to her toenails
Down to her feet, yeah

And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
Going back in Chinatown
Three's not a crowd to her, she says
"Room 714, I'll be waiting"
When I get there she's got incense, wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

Temptations sing!

Blow, Danny!
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm a' set straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage

So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage

Whyyyyyyyyyyy!?
Our backs are now against the wall
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm a' set straight this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgraced because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage
I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ohhhh
Oo oh oh oh oh

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life there's been heart-ache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've travelled so far
to change this lonely life

Chorus
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've travelled so far to change this lonely life

Chorus 5X
Last night, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now
And baby I feel so down
And I don't know why
I've been walking for miles

And people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned 'round,
Oh, baby gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night
Yeah

Oh it's alright, baby, yeah

Them people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And on top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah
I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I'm son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You, shut your mouth!
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am Human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry
And you want to die

When you say it's gonna happen now
Well, when exactly do you mean
See, I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

You, shut your mouth!
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
and if I make you happy I don't need to do more

Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be close to you
You make me feel so alive

you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

Ooh baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay
Need ya, need ya
Baby love, ooh, baby love

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we seperate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do
I get this need

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away

Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me
My love, my baby love

I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

Baby, baby, ooh 'til it's hurtin' me
'Til it's hurtin' me
Ooh, baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away
We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won as we sailed into the mystic
Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home
And when the fog horn blows I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will fold into the mystic

When that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows I got to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will fold into the mystic
Come on girl...

Too late to stop now...
Oh my God, ooh

Welcome to the jungle
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey we know the names

We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money honey
We got your disease

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay

And you're a very sexy girl
Who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal
In the jungle where we play

And if you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine

Jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees

Down in the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down
Huh
As I walk along, I wonder
what went wrong with our love,
a love that was so strong.
And as I still walk on, I think of
the things we've done together,
awhile our hearts were young.

I'm a walkin' in the rain,
tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,
Wishin' you were here by me,
to end this misery
and I wonder...

I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder,
Why, Why, why, why, why, why
she ran away,
and I wonder,
where she will stay-ay,
My little runaway,

Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Mother told me, yes, she told me
That I'd meet girls like you.
She also told me, "Stay away,
You'll never know what you'll catch."
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off.
Some Indonesian junk
That's going round.

(Chorus)
Your Mommy's all right,
Your Daddy's all right,
They just seem a little weird.
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away,
Hey, heeeeeey.

Father says, "Your mother's right,
She's really up on things.
Before we married, Mommy served
In the WACS in the Philippines."
Now, I had heard the WACS recruited
Old maids for the war.
But mommy isn't one of those,
I've known her all these years.

(Chorus)
Your Mommy's all right,
Your Daddy's all right,
They just seem a little weird.
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away,
Hey, heeeeeey.

Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking,
Here'd they disappear?
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad
Are rolling on the couch.
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin',
Got my KISS records out.

(Chorus)
Your Mommy's all right,
Your Daddy's all right,
They just seem a little weird.
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away,
Hey, heeeeeey.

Away...
Away...

Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away
(repeat to fade)
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
If the rain comes
they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes

When the sun shines
they slip into the shade
and sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

I can show you
that when it starts to rain
everything's the same
I can show you

Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine

Can you hear me
that when it rains and shines
it's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
If you disrespect anybody that you run in to
How in the world do you think anybody's s'posed to respect you
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man with the bible in his hand
Just get out the way, and let the gentleman do his thing
You the kind of gentleman that want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy, it's a brand new day

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself


Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself

If you're walking 'round think'n that the world owes you something cause
You're here you goin' out the world backwards like you did when you
Put your hand on your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution
Oh, you cuss around women and you don't even know their names and you
Dumb enough to think that'll make you a big ol man

Better trust than believe em
In the cut where I keep em

Then it's, beep beep and I'm pickin em up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs

Nigga it's the - big Southern rap impresario

Makes a mill' up off a sorry hoe
Then sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No I can't fuck a scary hoe
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin - they say, "There he go!"
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab
Don't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me
and you see us comin down on yo' slab
Livin ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin I
then you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked, just break it
You gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin to the track
Timbaland let me spit my pro's on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
But when shit get hot, then the glock start poppin like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
Fo' real it don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin throwed on the flip

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Full of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.
I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made the big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death
And you can't help me not, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet silly talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man can not be free
Of all of the evils of this town
And of himself, and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town
And all the politicians makin' busy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

'Cause when the smack begins to flow
Then I really don't care anymore
Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
Then thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess I just don't know
Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is. Let's ask her.
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mm-hmm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Uh-uh
By the way, where'd you meet him?

I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture? (yes, we see)
That's when I fell for (the leader of the pack)
My folks were always putting him down (down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(whatcha mean when ya say
that he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for
(the leader of the pack)
One day my dad said, "Find someone new"
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
(whatcha mean when ya say that
ya better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you
(the leader of the pack)

He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
But whether he heard, I'll never know
Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out!

I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him (the leader of the pack)

The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
Hmm hmm hmm, yeah... [3x]

It is you (oh yeah)
It is you, you (oh yeah)
It is you (oh yeah)

Cause a pressure drop, oh pressure
Oh yeah pressure drop a drop on you
I say a pressure drop, oh pressure


Oh yeah pressure drop a drop on you

I say when it drops, oh you gonna feel it
Know that you were doing wrong.

Hmm hmm hmm, yeah... [3x]
I say a pressure drop, oh pressure
Oh yeah, pressure drop a drop on you [2x]

Oo-ee-oo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

Bang, bang, a knock on the door
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Oh no, what do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
Wassa matter babe are you feelin' sick?
Wassa matter, wassa matter, wassa matter you?
Wassa matter babe, are you feelin' blue, and oh

And that's for all time (that's for all time)

Oo-ee-oo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Oooh oooh oooh oooh

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you tonight
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
The phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah

Ooh baby why you wait so long
Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come home, come home

I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh

I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else

Aaah aaah aaah aaah

Yes, baby
Can't see nothin' in front of me
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
I make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile of line

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
I was wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li

There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li

I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mixed with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line

Sky of blackness and sorrow (a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness (a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow (a dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65 I was seventeen and running up one-oh-one
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69 I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
I look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes, I see them running too

(Running on) Running on empty
(Running on) Running blind
(Running on) Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Honey, you really tempt me, you know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on) You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind) Running into the sun but I'm running behind
Gold Coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in a market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver, know he's doing alright
Hear him whip the women just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good?
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should, uh huh

Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wond'ring where it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doing alright
You shoulda heard him just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good, now?
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should, now

Ah, get along
Brown sugar, how come you taste so good, babe?
Ah, got me feelin' now
Brown sugar, just like a black girl should, yeah

Now, I bet your mama was a tent show queen
And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
I'm no schoolboy, but I know what I like
You shoulda heard me just around midnight

Brown sugar, how come you taste so good, babe?
Ah, brown sugar, just like a young girl should, yeah

I said yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
How come you, how come you taste so good?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

Outro:

Girl we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Strokin' round and round
To the remix
We jus' thuggin' it out
I'm Feelin rough I'm Feelin raw I'm in the prime of my life.
Let's make some music make some money find some models for wives.
I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin and fuck with the stars.
You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars.

This is our decision to live fast and die young.
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun.
Yeah it's overwhelming, but what else can we do?
Get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute?

Forget about our mothers and our friends.
We were fated to pretend.

I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms.
I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world.
I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home.
Yeah I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone.

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do.
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew.
The models will have children, we'll get a divorce,
we'll find some more models, Everything must run its course.

We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end.
We were fated to pretend.

yeah yeah yeah
At first I was afraid,
I was petrified,
kept thinking I could never live without you by my side,
but then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong,
and I grew strong,
and I learned how to get along!

And so you're back, from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
if I had known for just one second,
you'd be back to bother me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
and I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself,
I used to cry,
but now I hold my head up high,
and you see me,
somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
and so you felt like dropping in,
and just expect me to be free,
but now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me.

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive, I will survive!

Go now go,
walk out the door,
just turn around now,
cause you're not welcome anymore,
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,
you'd think I'd crumble,
you'd think I'd lay down and die!

Oh no not I,
I will survive,
Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live,
I've got all my love to give,
I will survive,
I will survive,
I will survive!
I Love Rock N' Roll

I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must a been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong

Till he was with me, yeah me

So come an' take your time an' dance with me
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
Tigers waiting to be tamed, singing

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Curse missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

Nothing else compares
Oh, no nothing else compares
Oh, no nothing else compares

You are
You are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Oh when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof.
And your shoes get so hot, you wish your tired feet were fire-proof.
Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be.

(Under the Boardwalk)
Out of the sun.
(Under the Boardwalk)
Man, we'll be having some fun.
(Under the Boardwalk)
People walkin' above.
(Under the Boardwalk)
We'll be falling in love under the Boardwalk,

Boardwalk.

From the palms you hear the happy sounds of the carousel,
and you can almost taste the hot-dogs and french fries they sell.
Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
on a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be.

(Under the Boardwalk)
Out of the sun.
(Under the Boardwalk)
Man, we'll be having some fun.
(Under the Boardwalk)
People walkin' above.

We'll be falling in love under the Boardwalk,

Boardwalk.

Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be.

Under the Boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby, is where I'll be.
'Show me, show me, show me
How you do that trick
The one that makes me scream,' she said
'The one that makes me laugh,' she said
And threw her arms around my neck
'Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise that
I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you...'

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
'Why are you so far away?' she said
'Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?'

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream
Just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
I found myself alone
Alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heaven
Lines form on my face and hands
Lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans
I'm a boy and I'm a man

I'm eighteen, and I don't know what I want
Eighteen, I just don't know what I want
Eighteen, I gotta get away
I've gotta get out of this place
I'll go runnin' in outer space, oh yeah

I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart
Took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about
Feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt

'Cause I'm eighteen, I get confused every day
Eighteen, I just don't know what to say
Eighteen, I gotta get away

Woah, lines form on my face and my hands
Lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle, the middle of life
I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it
Yes, I like it
Oh, I like it, love it, like it, love it
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen and I like it
They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

CHORUS (SHE)
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"

CHORUS (SHE)

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"

CHORUS (HE)
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American, he wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday?

Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have

CHORUS (YOU)
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?

CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times ad lib)
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American

Seeing her skin feeling silky smooth
Colour of cafe au lait

Roaring till it cried More, More, More
Now he's at home doing nine to five
Living his brave life of lies

All memories keep More, More, More

You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say, what you did,
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me, all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me, on the phone
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
To cry, cry me a river
Cry me a river, girl
Cry me a river
Cry me a river, girl yea yea

I know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
And all of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
(Yea..)

You don't have to say, what you did,

Go ask Alice when she's ten feet tall.

And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall,
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call.
Call Alice when she was just as small.

When men on a chessboard get up and tell you where to go,
And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low,
Go ask Alice -- I think she'll know.

When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead,
And the White Knight is talking backwards,
And the Red Queen's off with her head,

Blow, Danny!
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm a' set straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage

So listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet so don't you get souped yet
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage

Whyyyyyyyyyyy!?
Our backs are now against the wall
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage
Listen all of y'all it's a sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm a' set straight this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgraced because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage
I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ohhhh
Oo oh oh oh oh

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life there's been heart-ache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've travelled so far
to change this lonely life

Chorus
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've travelled so far to change this lonely life

Chorus 5X
Last night, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now
And baby I feel so down
And I don't know why
I've been walking for miles

And people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned 'round,
Oh, baby gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night
Yeah

Oh it's alright, baby, yeah

Them people, they don't understand
Your girlfriends, they can't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And on top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah
I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I'm son and heir
Of nothing in particular

You, shut your mouth!
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am Human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry
And you want to die

When you say it's gonna happen now
Well, when exactly do you mean
See, I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

You, shut your mouth!
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind

Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
and if I make you happy I don't need to do more

Cause you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

Oh, baby, what you've done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be close to you
You make me feel so alive

you make me feel,
you make me feel,
you make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

Ooh baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay
Need ya, need ya
Baby love, ooh, baby love

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we seperate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away

Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me
My love, my baby love

I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

Baby, baby, ooh 'til it's hurtin' me
'Til it's hurtin' me
Ooh, baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away
We were born before the wind
Also younger than the sun
Ere the bonnie boat was won as we sailed into the mystic
Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic

And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home
And when the fog horn blows I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And magnificently we will fold into the mystic

When that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows I got to hear it
I don't have to fear it

And I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
And together we will fold into the mystic
Come on girl...

Too late to stop now...
Oh my God, ooh

Welcome to the jungle
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey we know the names

We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money honey
We got your disease

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay

And you're a very sexy girl
Who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal
In the jungle where we play

And if you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle

It's gonna bring you down
Huh
As I walk along, I wonder
what went wrong with our love,
a love that was so strong.
And as I still walk on, I think of
the things we've done together,
awhile our hearts were young.

I'm a walkin' in the rain,
tears are fallin' and I feel the pain,
Wishin' you were here by me,
to end this misery
and I wonder...

I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder,
Why, Why, why, why, why, why
she ran away,
and I wonder,
where she will stay-ay,
My little runaway,

Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Run, run, run, run, runaway.
Mother told me, yes, she told me
That I'd meet girls like you.
She also told me, "Stay away,
You'll never know what you'll catch."
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off.
Some Indonesian junk
That's going round.

(Chorus)
Your Mommy's all right,
Your Daddy's all right,
They just seem a little weird.
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away,
Hey, heeeeeey.

Father says, "Your mother's right,
She's really up on things.
Before we married, Mommy served
In the WACS in the Philippines."
Now, I had heard the WACS recruited
Old maids for the war.
But mommy isn't one of those,
I've known her all these years.

(Chorus)
Your Mommy's all right,
Your Daddy's all right,
They just seem a little weird.
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away,
Hey, heeeeeey.

Whatever happened to all this season's
Losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking,
Here'd they disappear?
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad
Are rolling on the couch.
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin',
Got my KISS records out.

(Chorus)
Your Mommy's all right,
Your Daddy's all right,
They just seem a little weird.
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away,
Hey, heeeeeey.

Away...
Away...

Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away
Surrender,
Surrender,
But don't give yourself away
(repeat to fade)
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
If the rain comes

They might as well be dead

If you disrespect anybody that you run in to
How in the world do you think anybody's s'posed to respect you
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man with the bible in his hand
Just get out the way, and let the gentleman do his thing
You the kind of gentleman that want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy, it's a brand new day

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself


Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na na na na
Respect yourself, respect yourself

If you're walking 'round think'n that the world owes you something cause
You're here you goin' out the world backwards like you did when you
Put your hand on your mouth when you cough, that'll help the solution

Dumb enough to think that'll make you a big ol man

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine.

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Full of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway.

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange.

Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.
I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made the big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death
And you can't help me not, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet silly talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man can not be free
Of all of the evils of this town
And of himself, and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town
And all the politicians makin' busy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

'Cause when the smack begins to flow
Then I really don't care anymore
Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
Then thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess I just don't know
Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is. Let's ask her.
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mm-hmm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Uh-uh
By the way, where'd you meet him?

I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture? (yes, we see)
That's when I fell for (the leader of the pack)
My folks were always putting him down (down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(whatcha mean when ya say
that he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for
(the leader of the pack)
One day my dad said, "Find someone new"
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
(whatcha mean when ya say that
ya better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you
(the leader of the pack)

He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
But whether he heard, I'll never know
Look out! Look out! Look out! Look out!

I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him (the leader of the pack)

The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
The leader of the pack - now he's gone
Hmm hmm hmm, yeah... [3x]

It is you (oh yeah)
It is you, you (oh yeah)
It is you (oh yeah)

Cause a pressure drop, oh pressure
Oh yeah pressure drop a drop on you
I say a pressure drop, oh pressure


Oh yeah pressure drop a drop on you

I say when it drops, oh you gonna feel it
Know that you were doing wrong.

Hmm hmm hmm, yeah... [3x]
I say a pressure drop, oh pressure
Oh yeah, pressure drop a drop on you [2x]

All is quiet on New Year's day
A world in white gets underway
And I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day
On New Year's day
I... will be with you again
I... will be with you again

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined
The chosen few
The newspaper says, says
Says it's true, says it's true and
We can break through
Torn in two
We can be one
I... I will begin again
I... I will begin again

Yeah
Oh...

Oh and maybe the time is right
Oh... maybe tonight
I... will be with you again

And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
To be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day

On New Year's Day...
On New Year's Day...
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place in town
When some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Dragging kids out the ground

When it all was over
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the grand hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
And with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
We made our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, don't need no jewels in my crown

'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy, there's fever in the funk house now

This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't you see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes and sevens and nines

Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Got to roll me

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria
The subliminal mind fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who are meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well maybe I am the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who are meant to follow

One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's going out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation

Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who are meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down

And everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

William, it was really nothing
William, it was really nothing
It was your life

How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:
"Would you like to marry me
And if you like you can buy the ring"
She doesn't care about anything

"Would you like to marry me
And if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
Except myself

William, it was really nothing

William, William
Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, cat, go.

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes.

Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name
All over the place.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

You can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor
From an old fruitjar.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"

La la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

CHORUS:
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me,"
As a smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davey, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

CHORUS

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

CHORUS
IT'S YOUR THING

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.(repeat)

VERSE 1
If you want me to love you, maybe I will.
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal.
You need love now, just as bad as I do.
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to.

[Dr.Dre]
Right about now, NWA court is in full effect.
Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy mother fucking E.
Order, order, order. Ice Cube, take the mother fucking stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
[Ice Cube]
You're goddamn right!
[Dr.Dre]
Why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Ice Cube]
Fuck the police
Comin’ straight from the underground
Young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk mother fucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin’ on, and throw in jail
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searching my car, looking for the product
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Then me and Lorenzo rolling in the Benzo
Beat the police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still can't swallow bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any mother fucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young nigga on a war path
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in LA
Yo Dre, I got something to say

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (4X)

[Dr.Dre]
Example of scene one:
Pull your goddamn ass over right now
[MC Ren]
Ah shit, what the fuck you pulling me over for?
[Dr.Dre]
Cause I feel like it, Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
[MC Ren]
Man, fuck this shit
[Dr.Dre]
Alright smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail
M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up
incident.




[MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
because the niggaz on the street is a majority.
A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
and the mother fucking weapon
is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law
wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
To the police I'm saying fuck you punk
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time
Smoke any mother fucker that sweats me
Or any ass hole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The mother fucking villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound [Bang, Bang]
Ya, something like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (4X)

[Eazy-E]
Yo, man, what you need?
[Dr.Dre]
Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands up where I can see em
Just shut the fuck up and get your muthafuckin ass on the floor [Huh]
Yo Eazy-E, why don't you step up to the stand
and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit

[Eazy-E]
I'm tired of the mother fucking jacking
Sweating my gang while I'm chilling in the shacking
Shining the light in my face, and for what
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid assed nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK Cause the police always got something stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot,
By me, or another nigga.
and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
[MC Ren: Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool]
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror
And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb mother fucker with a gun
And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
And while I'm driving off laughing
This is what I'll say

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (4X)

[Dr.Dre]
The verdict
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck,
white bread, chicken shit mother fucker
Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie
I want justice! I want justice!
Fuck you, you black mother fucker

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (3X)
Intro:
(fuck all you hoes) Get a grip motherfucker.
Yeah this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothin' to all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on
me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter
and all the niggaz in the struggle you know what I'm sayin'?
Uh ha it's all good baby bay-bee, uh

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood
It's all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

Chorus:
You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honies play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, endo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

chorus:
you know very well who you are
dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause your the only one i'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all...
(It's all good)
...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

chorus:
you know very well who you are
dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause your the only one i'll give you good and plenty

Uh, uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh
Uh, yeah, a-ight

chorus:
you know very well who you are
don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause your the only one i'll give you good and plenty MUTHA FUCKA
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But, babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow
And you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
"Don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let 'em go, but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down
And the radio on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back
And those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Now if you feel that you can't go on (can't go on),
Because all of your hope is gone (all your hope is gone),
And your life is filled with much confusion (much confusion),
Until happiness is just an illusion (happiness is just an illusion),

Young Blood
I saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin
Look a-there Look a-there
Look a-there Look a-there

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name What's your name
What's your name What's your name

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"

I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin'
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she walks by, the men folks get engrossed,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she winks an eye, the bread slice turn to toast,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she got a lot, of what they call the most,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it, she was born to please,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
And if she's got, a figure made to squeeze,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
Won't you kindly be aware, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it,
If she mesmerizes, every mother's son,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,


If she's smiling, beefsteak become well done,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
She makes grand pa feel like twenty one,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it, she was born to please,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
And if I go to her, on bended knees,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
Won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it,
I can't help it,
Because I'm hoping, obviously,
That some day, the answer would be,
The girl can't help it, she's in love with me,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it.
It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door "Y'all remember to wipe your feet"
And then she said "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge"
"Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please"
"There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow"
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
"I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right"
"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge"
"And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And Mama said to me "Child, what's happened to your appetite?"
"I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite"
"That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today"
"Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way"
"He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge"
"And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Ooh it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good

Ooh I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love

Ooh I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
I feel love

Ooh fall and free, fall and free
Fall and free, fall and free
Fall and free

Ooh you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me

Ooh I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love

Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey.

Everything is gonna burn, we'll all take turns.
I'll get mine, too.

Sweet emotion

You talk about things and nobody cares
You're wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make it clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year

Some sweat hod mama with a face like a gent
Said, "My 'get up and go' must have got up and went"
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You tellin' me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
Yes it did

You stand in the front just a-shakin' your ass
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eatin' from your hand
Sell the kids for food.
Weather changes moods.
Spring is here again.

White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
We've only begun

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start off walking and learn to run

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over, just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We'll sit here stranded, though were all doin' our best to deny it.
And Louise holds a handful of rain temptin' you to defy it.
The lights flicker from the opposite loft.
In this room the heat pipes just cough.
The country music station plays soft,
But theres nothing, really nothing, to turn off.
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain,
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D train.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight,
Ask himself if its him or them that's insane.
Louise she's all right, she's just near,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here.
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And when bringing her name up he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
He's sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all,
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall.
Oh, how can I explain? its so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.

Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while.
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues,
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
And the one with the mustache say jeez, I can't find my knees.
Both jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him.
Saying name me someone thats not a parasite and I'll go out
And say a prayer for him.
But like Louise always says, ya can't look at much can ya man
As she herself prepares for him
My Madonna she still has not showed,
We see this empty cage now corrode,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes.
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Jay-Z:

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
He came last night out of sadness
And it was clear that she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared (Saying don't be afraid)
Come on baby (And she had no fear)
And she ran to him (Then they started to fly)
They looked backward and said goodbye (She had become like they are)
She had taken his hand (She had become like they are)
Come on baby (Don't fear the reaper)
(Written by George "Shadow" Morton)

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
He went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we were through
He found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do?
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no

(Remember) walkin' in the sand

(Remember) smile was so inviting
(Remember) then he touched my cheek

Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips

Whatever happened to
The boy that I once knew?
The boy who said he'd be true
Oh, what will happen to
The life I gave to you?
What will I do with it now?

All is quiet on New Year's day
A world in white gets underway
And I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day
On New Year's day
I... will be with you again
I... will be with you again

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined
The chosen few
The newspaper says, says
Says it's true, says it's true and
We can break through
Torn in two
We can be one
I... I will begin again
I... I will begin again

Yeah
Oh...

Oh and maybe the time is right
Oh... maybe tonight
I... will be with you again
I... will be with you again

And so we are told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
To be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day

On New Year's Day...
On New Year's Day...
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place in town
When some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Dragging kids out the ground

When it all was over
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the grand hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
And with the rolling truck stones thing just outside
We made our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
A fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, don't need no jewels in my crown

'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy, there's fever in the funk house now

This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't you see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money, I'm all sixes and sevens and nines

Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Got to roll me

Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
And can you hear the sound of hysteria
The subliminal mind fuck America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who are meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

Well maybe I am the faggot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who are meant to follow

Don't want to be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's going out to idiot America

Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who are meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down

And everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

William, it was really nothing
William, it was really nothing
It was your life

How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say:
"Would you like to marry me
And if you like you can buy the ring"
She doesn't care about anything

"Would you like to marry me
And if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
Except myself

William, it was really nothing

William, William
Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, cat, go.

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes.

Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name
All over the place.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my Blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

You can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor
From an old fruitjar.

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes.
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"

La la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

CHORUS:
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me,"
As a smile ran away from his face
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davey, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

CHORUS

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

CHORUS
IT'S YOUR THING
The Isley Brothers

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.(repeat)

VERSE 1

And it's gotta be bumpin (City of Compton!)

[Dr. Dre]
It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin like a muh'fucker, but I ain't lynchin
Droppin the funky shit that's makin the sucka niggaz mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then I'm slippin
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., &amp;quot;No One Can Do it Better&amp;quot;

[Dr. Dre and Snoop]

[Dr.Dre]
Right about now, NWA court is in full effect.
Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube, and Eazy mother fucking E.
Order, order, order. Ice Cube, take the mother fucking stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
[Ice Cube]
You're goddamn right!
[Dr.Dre]
Why don't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Ice Cube]
Fuck the police
Comin’ straight from the underground
Young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk mother fucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin’ on, and throw in jail
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searching my car, looking for the product
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Then me and Lorenzo rolling in the Benzo
Beat the police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still can't swallow bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any mother fucker in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young nigga on a war path
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in LA
Yo Dre, I got something to say

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (4X)

[Dr.Dre]
Example of scene one:
Pull your goddamn ass over right now
[MC Ren]
Ah shit, what the fuck you pulling me over for?
[Dr.Dre]
Cause I feel like it, Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
[MC Ren]
Man, fuck this shit
[Dr.Dre]
Alright smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail
M. C. Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up
incident.




[MC Ren]
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
because the niggaz on the street is a majority.
A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping
and the mother fucking weapon
is kept in a stash box, for the so-called law
wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
To the police I'm saying fuck you punk
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time
Smoke any mother fucker that sweats me
Or any ass hole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The mother fucking villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound [Bang, Bang]
Ya, something like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (4X)

[Eazy-E]
Yo, man, what you need?
[Dr.Dre]
Police, open now. We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands up where I can see em
Just shut the fuck up and get your muthafuckin ass on the floor [Huh]
Yo Eazy-E, why don't you step up to the stand
and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit

[Eazy-E]
I'm tired of the mother fucking jacking
Sweating my gang while I'm chilling in the shacking
Shining the light in my face, and for what
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid assed nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK Cause the police always got something stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot,
By me, or another nigga.
and with a gat it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
[MC Ren: Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool]
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror
And there's no cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb mother fucker with a gun
And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
And while I'm driving off laughing
This is what I'll say

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (4X)

[Dr.Dre]
The verdict
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck,
white bread, chicken shit mother fucker
Wait, that's a lie. That's a goddamn lie
I want justice! I want justice!
Fuck you, you black mother fucker

[Eazy-E]
Fuck the police (3X)
Intro:
(fuck all you hoes) Get a grip motherfucker.
Yeah this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me
I'd never amount to nothin' to all the people that lived above the
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on
me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter
and all the niggaz in the struggle you know what I'm sayin'?
Uh ha it's all good baby bay-bee, uh

It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood
It's all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

Chorus:
You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a goal, but not that many
'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
Now honies play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the east coast
Condos in Queens, endo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Livin' life without fear
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

chorus:
you know very well who you are
dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause your the only one i'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all...
(It's all good)
...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh

chorus:
you know very well who you are
dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause your the only one i'll give you good and plenty

Uh, uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Uh...and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh
Uh, yeah, a-ight

chorus:
you know very well who you are
don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
you had a goal, but not that many
'cause your the only one i'll give you good and plenty MUTHA FUCKA
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But, babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
I see you walkin' real slow
And you're smilin' at everyone
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
"Don't look back, you can never look back"
I thought I knew what love was
What did I know
Those days are gone forever
I should just let 'em go, but

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got the top pulled down
And the radio on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got that hair slicked back
And those Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you
My love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Now if you feel that you can't go on (can't go on),
Because all of your hope is gone (all your hope is gone),
And your life is filled with much confusion (much confusion),
Until happiness is just an illusion (happiness is just an illusion),
And your world around is crumbling down, darlin',
(Reach out) Come on girl reach on out for me,

Young Blood
I saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin
Look a-there Look a-there
Look a-there Look a-there

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
What's your name What's your name
What's your name What's your name

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind

What crazy stuff She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"

I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin'
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one

Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she walks by, the men folks get engrossed,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she winks an eye, the bread slice turn to toast,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
If she got a lot, of what they call the most,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it, she was born to please,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
And if she's got, a figure made to squeeze,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
Won't you kindly be aware, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it,
If she mesmerizes, every mother's son,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,


If she's smiling, beefsteak become well done,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
She makes grand pa feel like twenty one,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
The girl can't help it, she was born to please,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
And if I go to her, on bended knees,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it,
Won't you kindly be aware, that I can't help it,
I can't help it,
Because I'm hoping, obviously,
That some day, the answer would be,
The girl can't help it, she's in love with me,
She can't help it, the girl can't help it.
It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door "Y'all remember to wipe your feet"
And then she said "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge"
"Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
"Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please"
"There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow"
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
"I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right"
"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge"
"And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

And Mama said to me "Child, what's happened to your appetite?"
"I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite"
"That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today"
"Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way"
"He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge"
"And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Ooh it's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good

Ooh I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love

Ooh I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love
I feel love
I feel love

Ooh fall and free, fall and free
Fall and free, fall and free
Fall and free

Ooh you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and me

Ooh I feel love, I feel love
I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love

Everything is gonna burn, we'll all take turns.

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

You talk about things and nobody cares
You're wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I gotta make it clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year

Some sweat hod mama with a face like a gent
Said, "My 'get up and go' must have got up and went"
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You tellin' me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me 'cause the rabbit done died
Yes it did

You stand in the front just a-shakin' your ass
I'll take you backstage, you can drink from my glass
I talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eatin' from your hand
Sell the kids for food.
Weather changes moods.
Spring is here again.

We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
We've only begun

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start off walking and learn to run
And yes, we've just begun

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over, just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over, just the two of us
Working together day to day, together, together

And when the evening comes, we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We'll sit here stranded, though were all doin' our best to deny it.
And Louise holds a handful of rain temptin' you to defy it.
The lights flicker from the opposite loft.
In this room the heat pipes just cough.
The country music station plays soft,
But theres nothing, really nothing, to turn off.
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain,
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D train.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight,
Ask himself if its him or them that's insane.
Louise she's all right, she's just near,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here.
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And when bringing her name up he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
He's sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all,
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall.
Oh, how can I explain? its so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.

Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while.
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues,
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
And the one with the mustache say jeez, I can't find my knees.
Both jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him.
Saying name me someone thats not a parasite and I'll go out
And say a prayer for him.
But like Louise always says, ya can't look at much can ya man
As she herself prepares for him
My Madonna she still has not showed,
We see this empty cage now corrode,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes.
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
He came last night out of sadness
And it was clear that she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared (Saying don't be afraid)
Come on baby (And she had no fear)
And she ran to him (Then they started to fly)
They looked backward and said goodbye (She had become like they are)
She had taken his hand (She had become like they are)
Come on baby (Don't fear the reaper)
(Written by George "Shadow" Morton)

Seems like the other day
My baby went away
He went away 'cross the sea
It's been two years or so
Since I saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
It said that we were through
He found somebody new
Oh, let me think, let me think, what can I do?
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no

(Remember) walkin' in the sand
(Remember) walkin' hand in hand
(Remember) the night was so exciting
(Remember) smile was so inviting
(Remember) then he touched my cheek


(Remember) with his fingertips
Softly, softly we'd meet with our lips

Whatever happened to
The boy that I once knew?
The boy who said he'd be true
Oh, what will happen to
The life I gave to you?
What will I do with it now?

Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city

All around, people looking half dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come-on come-on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright

And babe, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city

Cool town, evening in the city
Dressing so fine and looking so pretty
Cool cat, looking for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come-on come-on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright

And babe, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city

And babe, don't you know it's a pity
That the days can't be like the nights
In the summer, in the city
In the summer, in the city
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to me...

But it was just my 'magination
running away with me.
It was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married..
and raise a family.
In a cozy, little home out in the country
with two children, maybe three.
I tell you, I can visualize it all.
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my 'magination -- once again --
running away with me.
I tell you it was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Paul: Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me
or I will surely die..&amp;quot;
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination -- once again --
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me.
I never met her, but I can't forget her.
Just my imagination..
-- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --
running away with me

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyes, pirate smile
You're marrying music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows
The tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You're marrying a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her,
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

repeat chorus 2x
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice

Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth

That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love

But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time, all the time

She said, "Free that brown-eyed man.
If you want your job, you better free that brown-eyed man."

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walkin' 'cross the sand.
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown-eyed handsome man,
Her destination was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Way back in history, three thousand years,
In fact ever since the world began,
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears
Over a brown-eyed handsome man,
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man.
Her mother told her, "Daughter go out and find yourself
A brown-eyed handsome man,
Just like your daddy was, a brown-eyed handsome man."

Marlo Venus was a beautiful lass,
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match

lightning struck itself.

Life in the hive puckered up my night,
the kiss of death, the embrace of life.
There I stand neath the Marquee Moon Just waiting,

I spoke to a man
down at the tracks.
I asked him
how he don't go mad.
He said "Look here junior, don't you be so happy.
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad."

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness standing on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch

And time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.

The next time you see me comin' you better run;"

God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose

And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song …

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn’t there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

oooooo
la la la la la la
ooooooooooo
la la laaaaa. la la la laaaaa

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly

He was strumming my pain
Yeah he was singing my life
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

It's not love

I can't get around it, no

Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind,
That's running wild.
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairytales,

That's all she ever thinks about ...

Riding with the wind.

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free.

It's alright, she says,
It's alright;
Take anything you want from me,
Anything.

Fly on, little wing.

Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well
Don't go round tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life

nice girls, not one with a defect
cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
red dogs under illegal legs
she looks so good that he gets down and begs

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectvies
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

long shot of that jumping sign
invisible shivers running down my spine
cut to baby taking off her clothes
close up of the sign that says 'we never close'

you snatch a chill, you match a cigarette
she pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

you think you're alone until you realise you're in it
now baby's here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window: i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute
it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
'Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven
Well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm,yay yay, yeah!

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm , mmmmm, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Still around
Everybody's doin' a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me;
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby.
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do.
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun,
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming.
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming.

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
With eyes as black as coal that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon.

I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
La la la, la la la, la la la la. (repeat)
Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

Hear me calling out to you,
Cause that's all that I can do.
Your eyes tell me to pursue.
But you say, &amp;quot;Look, yeah, but don't touch.&amp;quot;

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would dance upon a string.
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring.
I would give her anything,
If she would just do what I say.

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would love to take her home,
But her heart is made of stone.
Gotta keep on keeping on.
If I don't, she'll do me wrong.
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you know its hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man â€” yeah!
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can ?
Honey, you know I did!

Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night,
Babe, and I cry all the time!

Here's my story, its sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

yeah keep away from this girl. I don't know what she'll do...
keep away from sue!

She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to me...

But it was just my 'magination
running away with me.
It was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married..
and raise a family.
In a cozy, little home out in the country
with two children, maybe three.
I tell you, I can visualize it all.
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my 'magination -- once again --
running away with me.
I tell you it was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Paul: Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me
or I will surely die..&amp;quot;
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination -- once again --
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me.
I never met her, but I can't forget her.
Just my imagination..
-- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --
running away with me

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyes, pirate smile
You're marrying music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows
The tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You're marrying a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her,
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

repeat chorus 2x
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride

She took all my money
Wrecks my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinkin' in some cross town bar

Sometimes I feel

To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post

And I have to stand down and take it babe,
All for lovin' you

Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious

Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me

Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Chorus)
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea,
To the open arms of the sea.
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me.
I'll be coming home, wait for me."

(Chorus)
Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son,"
Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No," Abe say, "What?;"
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run;"
Well Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there's only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
0l' Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

ooooo

I heard he sang a good song

Embarrassed by the crowd

I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song …

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn’t there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

That's running wild.
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams

Riding with the wind.

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free.

It's alright, she says,
It's alright;
Take anything you want from me,
Anything.

Fly on, little wing.

Some of them want to abuse you

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well
Don't go round tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life

nice girls, not one with a defect
cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
red dogs under illegal legs
she looks so good that he gets down and begs

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectvies
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

long shot of that jumping sign
invisible shivers running down my spine
cut to baby taking off her clothes
close up of the sign that says 'we never close'

you snatch a chill, you match a cigarette
she pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

you think you're alone until you realise you're in it
now baby's here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window: i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute
it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
'Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven
Well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm,yay yay, yeah!

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm , mmmmm, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown

My little baby sister can do it with me;
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby.
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do.
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun,
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming.
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming.

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
With eyes as black as coal that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon.

I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.

Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)

Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)

But her heart is made of stone.
Gotta keep on keeping on.
If I don't, she'll do me wrong.
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you know its hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone

Here's my story, its sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

yeah keep away from this girl. I don't know what she'll do...
keep away from sue!

She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to me...

But it was just my 'magination
running away with me.
It was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married..
and raise a family.
In a cozy, little home out in the country
with two children, maybe three.
I tell you, I can visualize it all.
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my 'magination -- once again --
running away with me.
I tell you it was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Paul: Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me
or I will surely die..&amp;quot;
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination -- once again --
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me.
I never met her, but I can't forget her.
Just my imagination..
-- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --
running away with me

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyes, pirate smile
You're marrying music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows
The tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You're marrying a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her,
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

repeat chorus 2x
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice

Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice

I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah, oh

I've been run down
I've been lied to
I don't know why,
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecks my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinkin' in some cross town bar

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dyin'

My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand down and take it babe,
All for lovin' you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
Nothin' seems to change
Bad times stay the same
And I can't run

Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees yeah

But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me

I didn't sign up with you.
I'm not a present for your friends to open,
This boy's too young to be singing the blues.

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.
You can't plant me in your penthouse,
I'm going back to my plough.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.
You can't plant me in your penthouse,
I'm going back to my plough.

That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love

I could blow through the ceiling

It wears me out, it wears me out

If I could be who you wanted

Marlo Venus was a beautiful lass,
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown-eyed handsome man,
She fought and won herself a brown-eyed handsome man.

2-3 the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stands
Roundin' third, he was a-headin' for home
It was a brown-eyed handsome man that won the game
It was a brown-eyed handsome man.
Don't know much about history
Don't know much about biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

What I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
What I do know, one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now, I don't plan to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much about biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

What I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

What I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be
I remember
how the darkness doubled
I recall
lightning struck itself.
I was listening
listening to the rain
I was hearing
hearing something else.

Life in the hive puckered up my night,
the kiss of death, the embrace of life.
There I stand neath the Marquee Moon Just waiting,
Hesitating...
I ain't waiting

I spoke to a man
down at the tracks.
I asked him
how he don't go mad.
He said "Look here junior, don't you be so happy.
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad."

Well a Cadillac
it pulled out of the graveyard.
Pulled up to me
all they said get in.
Then the Cadillac
it puttered back into the graveyard.
And me,
I got out again.
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness standing on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary
(Ellas McDaniel) 1955

Now when I was a little boy,
At the age of five,
I had somethin' in my pocket,
Keep a lot of folks alive.

Now I'm a man,
Made twenty-one,

To Kansas to
Bring back the second cousin,
Little John the conqueroo.

The line I shoot,
Will never miss,
The way I make love to 'em,
They can't resist.

Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there

Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess

Reach out and touch faith

Your own personal Jesus

Reach out and touch faith
In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Chorus)
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea,
To the open arms of the sea.
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me.
I'll be coming home, wait for me."

(Chorus)
Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son,"
Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No," Abe say, "What?;"
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run;"
Well Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there's only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
0l' Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

ooooo

I heard he sang a good song

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song …

He sang as if he knew me
In all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn’t there
And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

Anything.

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well
Don't go round tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight

nice girls, not one with a defect
cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
red dogs under illegal legs
she looks so good that he gets down and begs

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectvies
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

long shot of that jumping sign
invisible shivers running down my spine
cut to baby taking off her clothes
close up of the sign that says 'we never close'

you snatch a chill, you match a cigarette
she pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

you think you're alone until you realise you're in it
now baby's here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window: i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute
it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?

My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm,yay yay, yeah!

Mm mm, mmmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm , mmmmm, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender

Everybody's doin' a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

My little baby sister can do it with me;
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby.
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do.
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun,
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming.
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming.

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
With eyes as black as coal that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon.

I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
La la la, la la la, la la la la. (repeat)
Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

Hear me calling out to you,
Cause that's all that I can do.
Your eyes tell me to pursue.
But you say, &amp;quot;Look, yeah, but don't touch.&amp;quot;

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would dance upon a string.
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring.
I would give her anything,
If she would just do what I say.

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would love to take her home,
But her heart is made of stone.
Gotta keep on keeping on.
If I don't, she'll do me wrong.
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you know its hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone

Here's my story, its sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

yeah keep away from this girl. I don't know what she'll do...
keep away from sue!

She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to me...

But it was just my 'magination
running away with me.
It was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married..
and raise a family.
In a cozy, little home out in the country
with two children, maybe three.
I tell you, I can visualize it all.
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my 'magination -- once again --
running away with me.
I tell you it was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Paul: Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me
or I will surely die..&amp;quot;
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination -- once again --
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me.
I never met her, but I can't forget her.
Just my imagination..
-- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --
running away with me

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyes, pirate smile
You're marrying music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows
The tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You're marrying a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her,
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

repeat chorus 2x
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice

Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice

I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah, oh

I've been lied to
I don't know why,
I let that mean woman make me a fool
She took all my money
Wrecks my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
They're drinkin' in some cross town bar

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Tied to the whipping post
Good lord I feel like I'm dyin'

My friends tell me
That I've been such a fool
And I have to stand down and take it babe,
All for lovin' you
I drown myself in sorrow
As I look at what you've done
Nothin' seems to change
Bad times stay the same
And I can't run

Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah

But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

No change, I can change

If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart
It makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then a baby I will, girl you know that I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I know deep down inside me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live

Tell it like it is
I'm nothing to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
But I... Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not your little boy
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm,
I should have listened to my old man.

You know you can't hold me forever,
I didn't sign up with you.
I'm not a present for your friends to open,
This boy's too young to be singing the blues.

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.
You can't plant me in your penthouse,
I'm going back to my plough.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.
You can't plant me in your penthouse,
I'm going back to my plough.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't country at all

Raving station, beside yourself

Keep me out of country in the world
Deal the porch is leading us absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the floor

One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss.

Shot rings out in the Memphis sky.

They could not take your pride.

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth

That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love

But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time, all the time

Oh, arrested on charges of unemployment
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judges wife called up the district attorney
She said, "Free that brown-eyed man.
If you want your job, you better free that brown-eyed man."

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walkin' 'cross the sand.
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown-eyed handsome man,
Her destination was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Way back in history, three thousand years,
In fact ever since the world began,
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears
Over a brown-eyed handsome man,
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man.
Her mother told her, "Daughter go out and find yourself
A brown-eyed handsome man,
Just like your daddy was, a brown-eyed handsome man."

Marlo Venus was a beautiful lass,
She had the world in the palm of her hand
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To win a brown-eyed handsome man,
She fought and won herself a brown-eyed handsome man.

2-3 the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stands
Roundin' third, he was a-headin' for home
It was a brown-eyed handsome man that won the game

I remember
how the darkness doubled
I recall
lightning struck itself.
I was listening
listening to the rain
I was hearing
hearing something else.

Life in the hive puckered up my night,
the kiss of death, the embrace of life.
There I stand neath the Marquee Moon Just waiting,
Hesitating...
I ain't waiting

I spoke to a man
down at the tracks.
I asked him
how he don't go mad.
He said "Look here junior, don't you be so happy.
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad."

Well a Cadillac
it pulled out of the graveyard.
Pulled up to me
all they said get in.
Then the Cadillac
it puttered back into the graveyard.
And me,
I got out again.
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness standing on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

Reach out and touch faith
In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Chorus)
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea,
To the open arms of the sea.
Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me.

Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son,"
Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No," Abe say, "What?;"
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run;"
Well Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there's only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run

And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.

you snatch a chill, you match a cigarette
she pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

you think you're alone until you realise you're in it
now baby's here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window: i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute
it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
'Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven
Well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm,yay yay, yeah!

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm , mmmmm, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Everybody's doin' a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me;
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby.
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do.
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun,
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming.
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming.

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
With eyes as black as coal that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon.

I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.

Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

Hear me calling out to you,
Cause that's all that I can do.
Your eyes tell me to pursue.
But you say, &amp;quot;Look, yeah, but don't touch.&amp;quot;

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would dance upon a string.
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring.
I would give her anything,
If she would just do what I say.

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would love to take her home,
But her heart is made of stone.
Gotta keep on keeping on.
If I don't, she'll do me wrong.
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you know its hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man â€” yeah!
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can ?
Honey, you know I did!

Here's my story, its sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

yeah keep away from this girl. I don't know what she'll do...
keep away from sue!

She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to me...

But it was just my 'magination
running away with me.
It was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married..
and raise a family.
In a cozy, little home out in the country
with two children, maybe three.
I tell you, I can visualize it all.
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my 'magination -- once again --
running away with me.
I tell you it was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Paul: Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me
or I will surely die..&amp;quot;
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination -- once again --
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me.
I never met her, but I can't forget her.
Just my imagination..
-- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --
running away with me

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyes, pirate smile
You're marrying music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows
The tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You're marrying a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her,
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

repeat chorus 2x
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah

I've been lied to
I don't know why,

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth

That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love

But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time, all the time

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walkin' 'cross the sand.
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown-eyed handsome man,
Her destination was a brown-eyed handsome man.

Way back in history, three thousand years,
In fact ever since the world began,
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears
Over a brown-eyed handsome man,
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed handsome man.

lightning struck itself.

Life in the hive puckered up my night,
the kiss of death, the embrace of life.
There I stand neath the Marquee Moon Just waiting,

I spoke to a man
down at the tracks.
I asked him
how he don't go mad.
He said "Look here junior, don't you be so happy.

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness standing on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch

And time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.

The next time you see me comin' you better run;"

God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose

And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.

It's not love

I can't get around it, no

Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind,
That's running wild.
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairytales,

That's all she ever thinks about ...

Riding with the wind.

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free.

It's alright, she says,
It's alright;
Take anything you want from me,
Anything.

Fly on, little wing.

Some of them want to abuse you

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well
Don't go round tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
nice girls, not one with a defect
cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
red dogs under illegal legs
she looks so good that he gets down and begs

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectvies
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

long shot of that jumping sign
invisible shivers running down my spine
cut to baby taking off her clothes
close up of the sign that says 'we never close'

you snatch a chill, you match a cigarette
she pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

you think you're alone until you realise you're in it
now baby's here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window: i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute
it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
'Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven
Well I bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm,yay yay, yeah!

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm , mmmmm, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Everybody's doin' a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me;
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby.
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do.
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun,
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming.
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming.

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
With eyes as black as coal that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon.

I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
La la la, la la la, la la la la. (repeat)
Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

Hear me calling out to you,
Cause that's all that I can do.
Your eyes tell me to pursue.
But you say, &amp;quot;Look, yeah, but don't touch.&amp;quot;

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would dance upon a string.
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring.
I would give her anything,
If she would just do what I say.

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would love to take her home,
But her heart is made of stone.
Gotta keep on keeping on.
If I don't, she'll do me wrong.
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you know its hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone

Didn't I make you feel like you were the only man â€” yeah!
An' didn't I give you nearly everything that a woman possibly can ?
Honey, you know I did!

Never, never, never, never, never, never hear me when I cry at night,
Babe, and I cry all the time!
But each time I tell myself that I, well I can't stand the pain,
But when you hold me in your arms, I'll sing it once again.

I'll say come on, come on, come on, come on and take it!
Take it!

Here's my story, its sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

yeah keep away from this girl. I don't know what she'll do...
keep away from sue!

She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow


Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of.........
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by.
I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy
To have a girl like her
is truly a dream come true.
Out of all of the fellas in the world
she belongs to me...

But it was just my 'magination
running away with me.
It was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hooh
Soon we'll be married..
and raise a family.
In a cozy, little home out in the country
with two children, maybe three.
I tell you, I can visualize it all.
This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems.

But it was just my 'magination -- once again --
running away with me.
I tell you it was just my 'magination
running away with me...

Paul: Every night, on my knees I pray,
Dear Lord, hear my plea...
don't ever let another take her love from me
or I will surely die..&amp;quot;
Ooh, her love is heavenly;
when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody...
but in reality, she doesn't even know me

Just my imagination -- once again --
running away with me.
It was just my imagination
running away with me.
I never met her, but I can't forget her.
Just my imagination..
-- ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah --
running away with me

Jesus freaks, out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the song
The words she knows
The tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here, with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
(repeat)

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile
You're marrying a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her,
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

repeat chorus 2x
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
And you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control
your body to dance (You got it) soul,
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, so let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck wit
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def wit the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can dance and clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

You got it (4x)
I know you got soul

Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I'll wait 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (5x)

I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R's requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to...
Whoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let him melt?
Then give him a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just cuz I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

You got it (4x)

Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,
The Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,
Even other states come right and exact,
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,
The rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace

You got it (10x)
I think I'm gonna be sad, I think it's today, Yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride

Wrecks my new car

They're drinkin' in some cross town bar

And I have to stand down and take it babe,

So goodbye yellow brick road,
Where the dogs of society howl.

Back to the howling old owl in the woods,
Hunting the horny back toad.
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane.
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement,
There's plenty like me to be found.
Mongrels, who ain't got a penny,
Sniffing for tit-bits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road,

In a town full of rubber plans

A cracked polystyrene man

For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears him out, it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing

It wears me out, it wears me out

Footprints dressed in red

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind cries Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine the emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary

In the white room with black curtains, near the station
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you, leaving my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze,
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
(Chorus)
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love.
God speed your love to me.

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea,
To the open arms of the sea.

Oh God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son,"
Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God say, "No," Abe say, "What?;"
God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run;"
Well Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?"
God says, "Out on Highway 61."

Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there's only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
0l' Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61.

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
I got forty red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61.

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light he says hmm you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly
With his song

ooooo

In all my dark despair

And he just kept on singing
Singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

It's alright;
Take anything you want from me,
Anything.

Fly on, little wing.

I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

Don't go around tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye

Well
Don't go round tonight
Oh it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

Don't come around tonight

nice girls, not one with a defect
cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
red dogs under illegal legs
she looks so good that he gets down and begs

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectvies
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

long shot of that jumping sign
invisible shivers running down my spine
cut to baby taking off her clothes
close up of the sign that says 'we never close'

you snatch a chill, you match a cigarette
she pulls your eyes out with a face like a magnet
i don't know how much more of this i can take
she's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake

she is watching the detectives
"oooh it's so cute!"
she is watching the detectives
when they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

they beat him up until the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded 'cos he's got no heart

you think you're alone until you realise you're in it
now baby's here to stay, love is here for a visit
they call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
someone's scratching at the window: i wonder who is it?
the detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
it only took my little fingers to blow you away

just like watching the detectives
don't get cute
it's just like watching the detectives
i get so angry when the teardrops start
but he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

watching the detectives
it's just like watching the detectives

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

Time can bring you down; time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please

Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
'Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven
Well I bless my soul

My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm mmmmm,yay yay, yeah!

Well my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm, mmmm ,yay, yay, yeah!

Well please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine
When I'm near that girl that I love best
My heart beats so that it scares me to death!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm , mmmmm, yay, yay , yeah!

Well my tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shaken like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have the girl that I love so fine!

She touched my hand what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to grieve all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender

Everybody's doin' a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now

My little baby sister can do it with me;
It's easier than learning your A-B-C's,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
You gotta swing your hips, now. Come on, baby.
Jump up. Jump back. Well, now, I think you've got the knack.

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control:
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul.
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion.
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
There's never been a dance that's so easy to do.
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue,
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me.
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
It is the special one, it's never seen the sun,
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming.
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming.

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem,
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem.
With eyes as black as coal that looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon.

I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.
I'm goin' to pick that rose and watch her as she grows in my garden.

Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)

Hear me calling out to you,
Cause that's all that I can do.
Your eyes tell me to pursue.
But you say, &amp;quot;Look, yeah, but don't touch.&amp;quot;

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Sexy lady. (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would dance upon a string.
Any gift she'd want, I'd bring.
I would give her anything,
If she would just do what I say.

Who's that lady? (Who's that lady?)
Beautiful lady. (Who's that lady?)
Lovely lady. (Who's that lady?)
Real real fine lady. (Who's that lady?)

I would love to take her home,
But her heart is made of stone.
Gotta keep on keeping on.
If I don't, she'll do me wrong.
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

CHORUS:
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
All the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind.
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in.
I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid.
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did.

Your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did.
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you know its hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you go it alone

Jim Dandy didn't need no suit
He was hip and ready to boot
Jim Dandy to the rescue
Go, Jim Dandy
Go, Jim Dandy

Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go, go, go Jim Dandy
Go on, Jim Dand
Jim Dandy, go
Here's my story, its sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

Ah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Ah, she likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

yeah keep away from this girl. I don't know what she'll do...
keep away from sue!

She likes to travel around
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys
Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue
